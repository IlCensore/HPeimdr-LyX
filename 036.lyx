, era questo quello che si provava a uscire dal Binario Nove e Tre Quarti
 verso il resto della Terra, il mondo che Harry aveva una volta pensato
 essere l'unico mondo reale.
 Persone vestite con camicie casual e pantaloni, invece delle vesti più
 dignitose dei maghi e delle streghe.
 Accumuli sparsi di spazzatura qua e là vicino le panchine.
 Un odore dimenticato, i fumi della benzina combusta, crudo e tagliente
 nell'aria.
 L'atmosfera della stazione ferroviaria di King's Cross, meno luminosa e
 allegra di Hogwarts o Diagon Alley; la gente sembrava più piccola, più
 paurosa, e probabilmente avrebbe scambiato con entusiasmo i suoi problemi
 col dover affrontare un mago oscuro.
 Harry voleva lanciare Scourgify per la sporcizia, ed Everto per la spazzatura,
 e se avesse conosciuto la formula, un Incantesimo Testa-Bolla così non
 avrebbe dovuto respirare l'aria.
 Ma non poteva usare la sua bacchetta, in questo luogo…

\begin_layout Standard
Questo, comprese Harry, era come ci si sentiva al passare da un Paese del

\begin_layout Standard
Solo era lo

 mondo che Harry aveva lasciato, il mondo dei maghi, degli Incantesimi di
 Pulizia e degli elfi domestici; dove, tra le arti dei guaritori e la tua
 stessa magia, potevi raggiungere i centosettanta anni di età prima che
 la vecchiaia iniziasse a raggiungerti.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
E la Londra non magica, la Terra babbana, alla quale Harry era temporaneamente
 tornato.
 Qui era dove Mamma e Papà avrebbero vissuto il resto delle loro vite, a
 meno che la tecnologia avesse fatto un balzo scavalcando la qualità della
 vita dei maghi, o qualcosa di più profondo nel mondo fosse cambiato.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Senza neppure pensarci, la testa di Harry si girò e i suoi occhi guizzarono
 dietro di lui per vedere il baule di legno che stava affrettandosi dietro
 di lui, inosservato da tutti i Babbani, i tentacoli artigliati che offrivano
 una rapida conferma che, sì, non si era immaginato tutto…

Il sorriso sul volto di suo padre non era molto ampio, d'altra parte suo

\begin_layout Standard
The sky was completely dark, and stars were coming out, by the time they
 negotiated the Christmas traffic to the university town that was Oxford,
 and parked in the driveway of the small, dingy-looking old house that their
 family used to keep the rain off their books.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As they walked up the brief stretch of pavement leading to the front door,
 they passed a series of flower-pots holding small, dim electric lights
 (dim since they had to recharge themselves off solar power during the day),
 and the lights lit up just as they passed.
 The hard part had been finding motion sensors that were waterproof and
 triggered at just the right distance…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Hogwarts there were real torches like that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then the front door opened and Harry stepped into their living-room,
 blinking hard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Every inch of wall space is covered by a bookcase.
 Each bookcase has six shelves, going almost to the ceiling.
 Some bookshelves are stacked to the brim with hardcover books: science,
 math, history, and everything else.
 Other shelves have two layers of paperback science fiction, with the back
 layer of books propped up on old tissue boxes or two-by-fours, so that
 you can see the back layer of books above the books in front.
 And it still isn't enough.
 Books are overflowing onto the tables and the sofas and making little heaps
 under the windows…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Verres household was just as he'd left it, only with more books, which
 was also just how he'd left it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry had spent the 23rd of December shopping for Muggle things that he
 couldn't just Transfigure; his father had been busy and had said that Harry
 would need to walk or take the bus, which had suited Harry just fine.
 Some of the people at the hardware store had given Harry questioning looks,
 but he'd said with an innocent voice that his father was shopping nearby
 and was very busy and had sent him to get some things (holding up a list
 in carefully adult-looking half-illegible handwriting); and in the end,
 money was money.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They had all decorated the Christmas tree together, and Harry had put a
 tiny dancing fairy on top (two Sickles, five Knuts at Gambol &amp; Japes).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gringotts had readily exchanged Galleons for paper money, but they didn't
 seem to have any simple way to turn larger quantities of gold into tax-free,
 unsuspicious Muggle money in a numbered Swiss bank account.
 This had rather spiked Harry's plan to turn most of the money he'd self-stolen
 into a sensible mix of 60% international index funds and 40% Berkshire
 Hathaway.
 For the moment, Harry had diversified his assets a little further by sneaking
 out late at night, invisible and Time-Turned, and burying one hundred golden
 Galleons in the backyard.
 He'd always always 
\emph on
always
\emph default
 wanted to do that anyway.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some of December 24th had been spent with the Professor reading Harry's
 books and asking questions.
 Most of the experiments his father had suggested were impractical, at least
 for the moment; of those remaining, Harry had done many of them already.
 (“Yes, Dad, I checked what happened if Hermione was given a changed pronunciati
on and she didn't know whether it was changed, that was the very first experimen
t I did, Dad!”)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last question Harry's father had asked, looking up from 
\emph on
Magical Draughts and Potions
\emph default
 with an expression of bewildered disgust, was whether it all made sense
 if you were a wizard; and Harry had answered no.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whereupon his father had declared that magic was unscientific.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry was still a little shocked at the idea of pointing to a section of
 
\emph on
reality
\emph default
 and calling it unscientific.
 Dad seemed to think that the conflict between his intuitions and the universe
 meant that the universe had a problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Then again, there were lots of physicists who thought that quantum mechanics
 was weird, instead of quantum mechanics being normal and them being weird.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry had shown his mother the healer's kit he'd bought to keep in their
 house, though most of the potions wouldn't work on Dad.
 Mum had stared at the kit in a way that made Harry ask whether Mum's sister
 had ever bought anything like that for Grandpa Edwin and Grandma Elaine.
 And when Mum still hadn't answered, Harry had said hastily that she must
 have just never thought of it.
 And then, finally, he'd fled the room.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lily Evans probably 
\emph on
hadn't
\emph default
 thought of it, that was the sad thing.
 Harry knew that other people had a tendency to not-think about painful
 subjects, in the same way they had a tendency not to deliberately rest
 their hands on red-hot stove burners; and Harry was starting to suspect
 that most Muggleborns rapidly acquired a tendency to not-think about their
 family, who were all going to die before they reached their first century
 anyway.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not that Harry had any intention of letting 
\emph on
that
\emph default
 happen, of course.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then it was late in the day on December 24th and they were driving off
 for their Christmas Eve dinner.

\begin_layout Standard
The house was huge, not by Hogwarts standards, but certainly by the standards
 of what you could get if your father was a distinguished professor trying
 to live in Oxford.
 Two stories of brick gleaming in the setting sun, with windows on top of
 windows and one tall window that went up much further than glass should
 go, that was going to be one huge living room…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry took a deep breath, and rang the doorbell.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a distant call of “Honey, can you get it?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This was followed by a slow patter of approaching steps.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then the door opened to reveal a genial man, of fat and rosy cheeks
 and thinning hair, in a blue button-down shirt straining slightly at the
 seams.

 “I'm Michael, and this is Petunia and our son Harry.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Yes, please, come in,” said Leo Granger.
 He stepped forward and took the wine bottle from the Professor's outstretched
 hands, with a muttered “Thank you,” and then stepped back and waved at
 the living room.
 “Have a seat.
 And,” his head turning down to address Harry, “all the toys are downstairs
 in the basement, I'm sure Herm will be down shortly, it's the first door
 on your right,” and pointed toward a hallway.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry just looked at him for a moment, conscious that he was blocking his
 parents from coming in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Toys?” said Harry in a bright, high-pitched voice, with his eyes wide.
 “I love toys!”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was an intake of breath from his mother behind him, and Harry strode
 into the house, managing not to stomp too hard as he walked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The living room was every bit as large as it had looked from outside, with
 a huge vaulted ceiling dangling a gigantic chandelier, and a Christmas
 tree that must have been murder to maneuver through the door.
 The lower levels of the tree were thoroughly and carefully decorated in
 neat patterns of red and green and gold, with a newfound sprinkling of
 blue and bronze; the heights that only a grownup could reach were carelessly,
 randomly draped with strings of lights and wreaths of tinsel.
 A hallway extended until it terminated in the cabinetry of a kitchen, and
 wooden stairs with polished metal railings stretched up toward a second
 floor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Gosh!” Harry said.
 “This is a big house! I hope I don't get lost in here!”

Roberta Granger was feeling rather nervous as dinner approached.
 The turkey and the roast, their own contributions to the common project,
 were steadily cooking away in the oven; the other dishes were to be brought
 by their guests, the Verres family, who had adopted a boy named Harry.
 Who was known to the wizarding world as the Boy-Who-Lived.
 And who was also the only boy that Her\SpecialChar \-
mione had ever called “cute”, or
 noticed at all, really.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Verreses had said that Hermione was the only child in Harry's age group
 whose existence their son had ever acknowledged in any way whatsoever.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And it might've been jumping the gun just a little; but both couples had
 a sneaking suspicion that wedding bells might be in the offing a few years
 down the road.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So while Christmas Day would be spent, as always, with her husband's family,
 they'd decided to spend Christmas Eve meeting their daughter's possible
 future in-laws.

\begin_layout Standard
The doorbell rang while she was right in the middle of basting the turkey,
 and she raised her voice and shouted, “

“Yes, please, come in,” said her husband, followed by a muttered “Thank
 you” that indicated some sort of present had been accepted, and “Have a
 seat.” Then Leo's voice altered to a tone of artificial enthusiasm, and
 said, “And all the toys are downstairs in the basement, I'm sure Herm will
 be down shortly, it's the first door on your right.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a brief pause.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then a young boy's bright voice said, “Toys? I love toys!”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was the sound of footsteps entering the house, and then the same bright
 voice said, “Gosh! This is a big house! I hope I don't get lost in here!”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Roberta closed up the oven, smiling.
 She'd been a bit worried about the way Hermione's letters had described
 the Boy-Who-Lived

 though certainly her daughter hadn't said anything indicating that Harry

\emph default
 nothing like the dark hints written in the books Roberta had bought, supposedly
 for Hermione, during their trip to Diagon Alley.
 Her daughter hadn't said much at all, only that Harry talked like he came
 out of a book, and Hermione was studying harder than she ever had in her
 life just to stay ahead of him in class.
 But from the sound of it, Harry Potter was an ordinary eleven-year-old
 boy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She got to the front door just as her daughter came clattering frantically
 down the stairs at a speed that didn't look safe at all, Hermione had claimed
 that witches were more resistant to falls but Roberta wasn't quite sure
 she believed that

Roberta took in her first sight of Professor and Mrs.
 Verres, who were both looking rather nervous, just as the boy with the
 legendary scar on his forehead turned to her daughter and said, now in
 a lower voice, “Well met on this fairest of evenings, Miss Granger.” His
 hand stretched back, as though offering his parents on a silver platter.
 “I present to you my father, Professor Michael Verres-Evans, and my mother,
 Mrs.
 Petunia Evans-Verres.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And as Roberta's mouth was gaping open, the boy turned back to his parents
 and said, now in that bright voice again, “Mum, Dad, this is Hermione!
 She's really smart!”

\begin_layout Standard
“

 “Stop that!”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The boy swiveled again to regard Hermione.
 “I'm afraid, Miss Granger,” the boy said gravely, “that you and I have
 been exiled to the labyrinthine recesses of the basement.
 Let us leave them to their adult conversations, which would no doubt soar
 far above our own childish intellects, and resume our ongoing discussion
 of the implications of Humean projectivism for Transfiguration.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Excuse us, please,” said her daughter in a very firm tone, and grabbed
 the boy by his left sleeve, and dragged him into the hallway

“I, ah, I apologize for…” said Mrs.
 Verres in a faltering voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I'm sorry,” said the Professor, smiling fondly, “Harry can be a bit touchy
 about that sort of thing.
 But I expect he's right about us not being interested in their conversation.”

 But Professor McGonagall had made other visits after her first trip, to

Harry was having a bit of trouble concentrating on the turkey.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The conversation had turned to Hogwarts, naturally; and it'd been obvious
 to Harry that his parents were hoping that Hermione would trip up and say
 more about Harry's school life than Harry had been telling them.
 And either Hermione had realized this, or she was just automatically steering
 clear of anything that might prove troublesome.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So 
\emph on
Harry
\emph default
 was fine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But unfortunately Harry had made the mistake of owling his parents with
 all sorts of facts about Hermione that she hadn't told her

own

 parents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like that she was general of an army in their after-school activities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hermione's mother had looked very alarmed, and Harry had quickly interrupted
 and done his best to explain that all the spells were stunners, Professor
 Quirrell was always watching, and the existence of magical healing meant
 that lots of things were much less dangerous than they sounded, at which
 point Hermione had kicked him hard under the table.
 Thankfully Harry's father, who Harry had to admit was better than him at
 some things, had announced with firm professorial authority that he hadn't
 worried at all, since he couldn't imagine children being allowed to do
 it if it was dangerous.

Leo Granger had asked, at one point, whether that nice teacher who'd seemed
 to like Hermione, Professor McGonagall, was awarding her lots of points
 in school.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hermione had said yes, with an apparently genuine smile.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry had managed, with some effort, to stop himself from icily pointing
 out that Professor McGonagall would never show favoritism to any Hogwarts
 student, and that Hermione was getting lots of points because she'd earned
 
\emph on
every, single, one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At another point, Leo Granger had offered the table his opinion that Her\SpecialChar \-

 if not for the whole witch business.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hermione had smiled again, and a quick glance had prevented Harry from suggestin

, and asking whether that thought would've occurred to the Grangers if they'd
 had a 
\emph on
son
\emph default
 instead of a

daughter
\emph default
, or if it was unacceptable either way for their offspring to do better
 than them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But Harry was rapidly reaching his boiling point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And becoming a

lot
\emph default
 more appreciative of the fact that his own father had

\emph default
 done everything he could to support Harry's development as a prodigy and
 
\emph on

\emph default
 encouraged him to reach higher and 
\emph on
never

 was still just a child.
 Was this the sort of household he could have ended up in, if Mum had married

Harry was doing what he could, though.

“And she's really beating you in

“Yes,” Harry said with forced calm, as he cut himself another bite of Christmas
 Eve turkey.
 “By solid margins, in most of them.” There were other circumstances under
 which Harry would have been more reluctant to admit that, which was why
 he hadn't gotten around to telling his father until now.

“I'm not embarrassed to lose to her, Dad,” Harry said.
 Right at this moment he wasn't.
 “Did I mention that she memorized all her schoolbooks before the first
 day of class? And yes, I tested it.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Is that, ah,

usual

 “She knows every recipe in all my cookbooks by heart.

 of what Harry felt.

“Don't worry, Dad,” Harry said, “she's getting all the advanced material

His voice had risen on the last three words, and even as all faces turned
 to stare at him and Hermione kicked him again, Harry knew that he'd blown
 it, but it was too much, just way too much.

\begin_layout Standard
“Of course we know she's smart,” said Leo Granger, starting to look offended
 at the child who'd had the temerity to raise his voice at their dinner
 table.

“You don't have the tiniest idea,” said Harry, the ice now leaking into
 his voice.

Hermione, who had calmly got up from her seat and walked around the table,
 chose that moment to grab Harry's shirt by the shoulder and pull him out
 of his chair.
 Harry let himself be pulled, but as Hermione dragged him away, he said,
 raising his voice even louder, “It is entirely possible that in a thousand
 years, the fact that Hermione Granger's parents were dentists will be the
 only reason anyone remembers dentistry!”

“Please don't, Harry,” she said in a soft voice.
 “Even though it's very nice of you.

Harry just looked at her.
 “How can you stand it?” he said.

 it rose in pitch if not in volume.
