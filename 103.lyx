4 giugno 1992

\begin_layout Standard
Daphne Greengrass si trovava nella sala comune Serpeverde, a scrivere una
 lettera alla sua Lady Madre (che era sorprendentemente intransigente riguardo
 alla condivisione del potere, sebbene non fosse nemmeno 
\emph on
a
\emph default
 Hogwarts per esercitare il suo controllo) quando vide Draco Malfoy entrare
 barcollando attraverso la porta ritratto, reggendo quelli che dovevano
 essere una dozzina di libri, Vincent e Gregory che lo seguivano portandone
 ciascuno un'altra dozzina.
 La testa dell'Auror che aveva accompagnato Malfoy fece brevemente capolino,
 per poi ritirarsi verso chissà-dove.
\end_layout

Draco si guardò attorno, poi sembrò essere colpito da un'idea brillante
 mentre barcollava verso di lei, Vincent e Gregory dappresso.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Daphne stava già scappando verso la propria stanza, correndo a prendere
 il libro di testo del primo anno di Difesa che non aveva toccato da settembre
 e urlando delle imprecazioni nella propria testa.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
One desk back of her, someone was crying, their soft sobs providing a background
 chant of despair for the classroom.
 Daphne looked back, expecting to see a Hufflepuff and hoping it wasn't
 Hannah, and was surprised at first (though not on further reflection) to
 see it was a Ravenclaw.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Before them were set the exam parchments, turned over, waiting for the bell.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Fifty minutes hadn't been nearly enough preparation time, but it was something,
 and Daphne was now feeling ashamed that she hadn't thought to send messengers
 to warn the Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Gryffindor Houses.
 They'd started giving House Points again just three days ago, at the beginning
 of June, but the Auxiliary Protective Special Committee still ought to
 promote House unity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Another Ravenclaw, sitting four desks to her left, also started to cry.
 That was Katherine Tung of Dragon Army, if she recalled correctly, whom
 she'd once seen take on three Sunshine Soldiers simultaneously without
 a flinch.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Daphne had calmed down after the first couple of minutes of frantic reading.
 It was just a test, not a 
\emph on
murder
\emph default
 or anything; and if almost all the first-year students turned in mostly
 blank parchments then it stood to reason that nobody would be shamed.
 But Daphne could understand, if not exactly sympathize, that Ravenclaws
 and Hufflepuffs might not see it that way.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
“He's evil,” another Ravenclaw witch said in a shaking voice.
 “One hundred percent pure Dark Wizard to the bone.
 The Dark Lord Grindelwald wouldn't do this, not to children, he's worse
 than You-Know-Who.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Daphne looked reflexively at where Professor Quirrell was sitting, slumped
 to one side but his eyes alert; and she thought she saw the Defense Professor
 smile for one tiny instant.
 No, that had to be her imagination, there was no way the Defense Professor
 could have heard that.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The bell rang.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Daphne flipped the parchment over.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The top was stamped with the seals for the Ministry, the Hogwarts Board
 of Governors, and the Department of Magical Education, and runes to detect
 cheating.
 Below that was a line for her to write her name, and a list of exam rules
 with a picture of Lindsay Gagnon, the Director of the Department of Magical
 Education, shaking an admonishing finger at everyone.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Halfway down the page was the first exam question.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It was, 
\emph on
Why is it important for children to stay away from strange creatures?
\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
There was a stunned pause.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
One student began laughing, she thought it was from the Gryffindor section
 of the class.
 Professor Quirrell made no motion to censor it, and the laughter spread.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Nobody spoke aloud, but the students looked around at each other, exchanging
 glances as the laughter died down, and then as if by some unspoken agreement
 they all looked at Professor Quirrell, who was smiling down at them benevolentl
y.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Daphne bent over her exam, wearing a defiant evil smile that would have
 done proud to either Godric Gryffindor or Grindelwald; and she wrote down,
 
\emph on
Because my Stunning Hex, my Most Ancient Blade, and my Patronus Charm won't
 work against everything.

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Harry Potter turned over the last page of his Defense exam.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Even Harry had needed to quash a small bit of nervousness, some tiny remnant
 of his childhood, upon reading the first real question (`How can you make
 a Shrieking Eel be silent?').
 Professor Quirrell's lessons had spent roughly zero time on the surprising
 yet useless trivia that some idiot had imagined a `Defense class' should
 look like.
 In principle, Harry could have used his Time-Turner to read through the
 first-year Defense book after being notified of the surprise exam; but
 that might have unfairly skewed the grading curve for others.
 After staring at the question for a couple of seconds, Harry had written
 down `Quieting Charm', and included the casting directions in case the
 Ministry grader didn't believe that Harry knew it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Once Harry had decided to just answer all the questions 
\emph on
correctly,
\emph default
 the exam had gone by very quickly.
 The most realistic answer to more than half the questions was `Stunning
 Hex', and many of the other questions had optimal solutions along the lines
 of `Turn around and walk in the opposite direction' or `Throw away the
 cheese and buy a new pair of shoes.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The last question on the test was “What would you do if you suspected there
 might be a Bogeysnake underneath your bed?” The Ministry-approved answer,
 Harry could in fact recall from his read-through of the textbook at the
 start of the year, was 
\emph on
Tell your parents.

\emph default
 The problem with this had occurred to Harry right away, which was why Harry
 had remembered it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
After some pondering, Harry wrote down: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
\lang english
Dear Ministry grader: I'm afraid the real answer to that is a secret, but
 rest assured that a Bogeysnake would present no more trouble to me than
 a mountain troll, a Dementor, or You-Know-Who.
 Please inform your superiors that I find your standard answer prejudicial
 to Muggleborns, and that I expect this failing will be corrected at once
 without any need for my direct intervention.

\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
\lang english
Sincerely, the Boy-Who-Lived.

\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Harry signed the last parchment with a broad flourish, turned it over into
 his stack, put down his pen, and sat up.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Looking around, Harry saw that Professor Quirrell seemed to be looking in
 his rough direction, though the Defense Professor's head had nodded to
 one side.
 The other students were still writing.
 Some of them were silently crying, but they were still writing.
 
\emph on
Continuing to fight
\emph default
 was also a lesson Professor Quirrell had taught.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Interminably later, the official exam time was up.
 A seventh-year student went from desk to desk, collecting the exams in
 Professor Quirrell's place.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The last exam parchment was collected, and Professor Quirrell sat up straight.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
“My young students,” he said softly.
 The seventh-year student had her wand trained on the Defense Professor's
 mouth, so that they all heard his voice seeming to come from right beside
 them.
 “I know...
 that probably seemed very fearsome to some of you...
 it is a different kind of fear from facing the enemy's wand...
 you must conquer it separately.
 So I...
 shall tell you this now.
 It is the custom of Hogwarts...
 that grades are given in the second week of June.
 But for my case...
 they can make an exception, I think.” The Defense Professor smiled his familiar
 dry smile, tinged now as though by a suppressed grimace.
 “I know you are worried...
 that you were not prepared for this exam...
 that my lessons have not covered this material...
 and I quite forgot to mention...
 that it was approaching...
 though you should have known...
 it would come in time.
 But I have just now magically checked...
 the answers you have given on that...
 terribly, terribly important final exam...
 though of course only the Ministry grade is official...
 and assigned your full-year grades taking the results into account...
 and magically written your full grades down on these parchments,” Professor
 Quirrell tapped a stack of parchments on the side of his desk, “which will
 now be handed out...
 an incredible spell...
 is it not?” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
A few students on the Ravenclaw side were looking indignant, but for the
 most part the students just looked relieved, and some Slytherins were chuckling.
 Harry would have laughed too, if not for the pain of watching Professor
 Quirrell gasp out the words.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The seventh-year student standing beside Professor Quirrell pointed her
 wand and spoke an incantation in magical pseudo-Latin.
 The parchments rose up and started to drift through the air, separating
 in mid-flow to drift toward each student.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Harry waited until his parchment had arrived on his desk, and then unfolded
 it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The parchment said 
\noun on
ee
\noun default
+, which stood for Exceeds Expectations.
 It was the second-highest grade letter, the highest being Outstanding.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
In another world, a distant vanished world, a little boy named Harry would
 have shouted with indignation about receiving only the second-highest grade.
 This Harry sat quietly and thought.
 Professor Quirrell was making some point, and it wasn't as though the exact
 grade letter mattered in any other way.
 Was Professor Quirrell saying that Harry had done relatively well, but
 not lived up to his full potential? Or was the grade meant to be read literally
, that Harry had in fact exceeded the Defense Professor's expectations?
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
“All of you...
 pass,” Professor Quirrell said, as the students all looked at their final
 grades, as sighs of relief rose from desks and Lavender Brown raised her
 parchment in a clenched fist held high with triumph.
 “Every student in first-year Battle Magic has passed...
 except for one.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
A number of students looked up in sudden terror.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Harry sat there silently.
 He had seen the point immediately, and even if it was a wrong point, he
 knew Professor Quirrell would never, ever be talked out of making it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
“All of you in this room...
 have received grades of at least Acceptable.
 Neville Longbottom...
 who took this test in the Longbottom home...
 received a grade of Outstanding.
 But the other student who is not here...
 has had a Dreadful grade entered on her record...
 for failing the only important test...
 that was given her this year.
 I would have marked her even lower...
 but that would have been in poor taste.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The room was very quiet, though a number of students were staring angrily
 at the Professor.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
“You may think that a grade of Dreadful...
 is not fair.
 That Miss Granger was faced with a test...
 for which her lessons...
 had not prepared her.
 That she was not told...
 that the exam was coming on that day.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Defense Professor drew in a shaking breath.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
“Such is realism,” said Professor Quirrell.
 “The only important test...
 may come at any time...
 be better prepared for it...
 than she was.
 As for the rest of you...
 those who have received Exceeds Expectations or above...
 have received my letters of recommendation...
 to certain organizations beyond Britain's shores...
 where your training might be completed.
 They will contact you...
 when you are old enough...
 if you still appear worthy...
 and if you have not failed an important test.
 And remember...
 from this day...
 you must train yourselves...
 you cannot rely...
 on future Defense professors.
 Your first year of Battle Magic is over...
 you are dismissed.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Professor Quirrell sat back with his eyes closed, seeming to ignore the
 excited babble that broke out around him.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
In time most of the students had departed, and one remained, staying a prescribe
d distance from the Defense Professor.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Defense Professor opened his eyes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Harry raised the parchment with its

, still silent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Defense Professor smiled, and it went all the way to those tired eyes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
“It is the same grade...
 that I received in my own first year.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
“Th, th, th,” Harry couldn't make the words 
\emph on
thank you
\emph default
 come out, they were stuck in his suddenly closed throat, the Defense Professor
 tilting his head and giving him an inquiring stare, so Harry just bowed
 jerkily and then left the room.

Nine days yet remained.
