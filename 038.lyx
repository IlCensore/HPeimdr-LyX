, brillante l'aria, brillanti gli studenti e brillanti i loro genitori,
 pulito il pavimento della Piattaforma 9,75, il sole invernale basso nel
 cielo alle 9:45 del mattino del 5 gennaio 1992.
 Alcuni degli studenti più giovani indossavano sciarpe e guanti, ma la maggior
 parte indossavano semplicemente le loro vesti; erano maghi, dopotutto.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dopo essersi allontanato dalla piattaforma di arrivo, Harry si tolse la
 sciarpa e il cappotto, aprì un compartimento del suo baule, e mise da parte
 i suoi capi invernali.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Per un lungo momento, rimase in piedi lì, lasciando che l'aria di gennaio
 lo mordesse, giusto per vedere cosa si provasse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry tirò fuori le sue vesti da mago, e se le mise addosso.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
E infine, prese la sua bacchetta; e non poté pensare ai genitori ai quali
 aveva appena dato il bacio d'addio, al mondo i problemi del quale stava
 lasciandosi dietro…

Con una strana sensazione di colpevolezza per ciò che era ineluttabile,
 Harry disse,

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry sbadigliò e si allungò, sentendosi più letargico che altro alla fine
 della sua vacanza.
 Non si sentiva di leggere i suoi libri di testo, o anche qualunque fantascienza
 seria, quella mattina; ciò di cui aveva bisogno era qualcosa di completamente
 frivolo per tenere occupata la sua attenzione…

“Not me,” said the vendor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“They've even got a picture of the two of them together, so we know who
 it is that's secretly the same person.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Yup,” said the vendor.
 “Pretty clever disguise, innit?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“And I'm secretly sixty-five years old.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“You don't look half that,” the vendor said amiably.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“And I'm betrothed to Hermione Granger, 
\emph on
and
\emph default
 Bellatrix Black, 
\emph on
and
\emph default
 Luna Lovegood, and oh yes, Draco Malfoy too…”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Goin' ter be one interesting wedding,” said the vendor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry looked up from the newspaper, and said in a pleasant voice, “You know,
 I heard at first that Luna Lovegood was insane, and I wondered if she really
 was, or if she was just making stuff up and giggling to herself the whole
 time.
 Then when I read my second 
\emph on
Quibbler
\emph default
 headline, I decided that she 
\emph on
couldn't
\emph default
 be insane, I mean, it can't be 
\emph on
easy
\emph default
 to make this stuff up, you couldn't do it by 
\emph on
accident
\emph default
.
 And 
\emph on
now
\emph default
 do you know what I think? I think she must be mad after all.
 When ordinary people try to make stuff up, it doesn't come out like 
\emph on
this
\emph default
.
 Something's got to go really 
\emph on
wrong
\emph default
 with the inside of your head before 
\emph on
this
\emph default
 is what comes out when you start making stuff up!”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The vendor stared at Harry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Seriously,” said Harry.
 “Who 
\emph on
reads
\emph default
 this stuff?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“You,” said the vendor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry wandered off to read his newspaper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He didn't sit at the same nearby table he'd sat down at with Draco, the
 
\emph on
first
\emph default
 time he'd prepared to board this train.
 That seemed like tempting history to repeat itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It wasn't 
\emph on
just
\emph default
 that his first week at Hogwarts had been, judging by the 
\emph on
Quibbler
\emph default
, fifty-four years long.
 It was that, in Harry's humble opinion, his life did not 
\emph on
need
\emph default
 any new threads of complexity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So Harry found a small iron chair somewhere else, distant from the main
 crowd and the occasional muffled cracks of parents Apparating in with their
 children, and sat down and read the 
\emph on
Quibbler
\emph default
 to see if it contained any suppressed news.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And besides the obvious craziness (heaven help them all if any of 
\emph on
that
\emph default
 was real) there was a good deal of snide romantic gossip; but nothing that
 would really be all that 
\emph on
important
\emph default

\begin_layout Standard
“Lucius Malfoy,” Harry said, his voice weary.
 Next time he was going to do the smart thing, and wait outside in the Muggle
 part of King's Cross until 10:55am.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lucius inclined his head courteously, sending his long white hair drifting
 over his shoulders.
 The man was still carrying that same cane, lacquered in black with a silver
 snake's head for its handle; and something about his grip silently said
 
\emph on
this is a weapon of deadly power,
\emph default
 not 
\emph on
I am feeble and leaning on this.

\emph default
 His face was expressionless.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two men flanked him, their eyes continuously scanning, their wands already
 gripped low in their hands.
 The two of them moved like a single organism with four legs and four arms,
 the senior Crabbe-and-Goyle, and Harry thought he could guess which was
 which, but then it didn't really matter.
 They were merely Lucius's appendages, as certainly as if they'd been the
 two rightmost toes on his left foot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I apologize for disturbing you, Mr.

Potter,” said the smooth, silken voice.
 “But you have answered none of my owls; and this, I thought, might be my
 only opportunity to meet you.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I have received none of your owls,” Harry said calmly.
 “Dumbledore intercepted them, I presume.
 But I would not have answered them if I had, except through Draco.
 For me to deal with you directly, without Draco's knowledge, would trespass
 on our friendship.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Please go away, please go away…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The grey eyes glittered at him.
 “Is that your pose, then…” said the senior Malfoy.
 “Well.
 I shall play along a little.
 What was your purpose in maneuvering your good friend, my son, into a public
 alliance with that girl?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Oh,” Harry said lightly, “that's obvious, right? Draco's working with Gran\SpecialChar \-
ger
 will make him realize that Muggleborns are human after all.
 Bwa.
 Ha.
 Ha.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A thin trace of a smile moved over Lucius's lips.
 “Yes, that does sound like one of Dumbledore's plans.
 Which it is 
\emph on
not
\emph default
.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Indeed,” said Harry.
 “It is part of my game with Draco, and no work of Dumbledore's, and that
 is all I will say.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Let us dispense with games,” said the senior Malfoy, the grey eyes suddenly
 hardening.
 “If my suspicions are true, you would hardly do Dumbledore's bidding in
 any case,

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a slight pause.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“So you know,” Harry said, his voice cold.
 “Tell me.
 At which point, exactly, did you realize?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“When I read your response to Professor Quirrell's little speech,” said
 the white-haired man, and chuckled grimly.
 “I was puzzled, at first, for it seemed not in your own interest; it took
 me days to understand whose interest was being served, and then it all
 finally became clear.
 And it is also obvious that you are weak, in some ways if not others.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Very clever of you,” said Harry, still cold.
 “But perhaps you mistake my interests.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Perhaps I do.” A hint of steel came into the silken voice.
 “Indeed, that is precisely what I fear.
 You are playing strange games with my son, to a purpose I cannot guess.
 That is not a friendly act, and you cannot but 
\emph on
expect
\emph default
 me to be concerned!”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lucius was leaning upon his cane with both hands now, and both those hands
 white, and his bodyguards had suddenly tensed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some instinct within Harry claimed that it would be a very bad idea to show
 his fear, to let Lucius see that he could be intimidated.
 They were in a public train station anyway

 But it is irrelevant, Lucius.

He

“Company,” said one of the minions, and Harry thought, from the voice, that
 it must be the senior Crabbe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lucius straightened and turned, then let out a hiss of disapproval.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Neville was approaching, looking scared but determined, in tow behind a
 tall woman who didn't look scared at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Madam Longbottom,” Lucius said icily.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Mr.

 “Are you being an annoyance to our Harry Potter?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bark of laughter that came from Lucius seemed strangely bitter.
 “Oh, I rather think not.
 Come to protect him from me, have you?” The white-haired head shifted toward
 Neville.
 “And this would be Mr.

 How strangely does the world turn.
 Sometimes I think it must all be mad.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry had no idea at all what to say to that, and Neville looked confused,
 and frightened.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I doubt it is the world that is mad,” said Madam Longbottom.
 Her voice took on a gloating tone.
 “You seem in a poor mood, Mr.

Malfoy.
 Did the speech of our dear Professor Quirrell cost you a few allies?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“It was a clever enough slander of my abilities,” Lucius said coldly, “though
 only effective upon the fools who believe that I was truly a Death Eater.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“
\emph on
What?
\emph default
” blurted Neville.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I was under the

 young man,” said Lucius, now sounding tired.
 “The Dark Lord could hardly have begun recruiting among pureblood families
 without the support of House Malfoy.
 I demurred, and he simply made sure of me.
 His own Death Eaters did not know it until afterward, hence the false Mark
 I bear; though since I did not truly consent, it does not bind me.
 Some of the Death Eaters still believe I was foremost among their number,
 and for the peace of this nation I let them believe it, to keep them controlled.
 But I was not such a fool as to support that ill-fated adventurer of my
 own choice

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Ignore him,” Madam Longbottom said, the instruction addressed to Harry
 as well as Neville.
 “He must spend the rest of his life pretending, for fear of your testimony
 under Veritaseum.” Said with malicious satisfaction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lucius turned his back on her dismissively, and faced Harry again.
 “Will you request this harridan to depart,

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I think not,” said Harry in a dry voice.
 “I prefer to deal with the part of House Malfoy that's my own age.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a long pause, then.
 The grey eyes searched him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Of course…” said Lucius slowly.
 “I 
\emph on
do
\emph default
 feel the fool now.
 This whole time you were just pretending to have no idea what we were talking
 about.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry met the gaze, and said nothing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lucius raised his cane a few centimeters and struck it hard on the ground.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The world vanished in a pale haze, all sounds went quiet, there was nothing
 in the universe but Harry and Lucius Malfoy and the snake-headed cane.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“My son is my heart,” said the senior Malfoy, “the last worthwhile thing
 I have left in this world, and this I say to you in a spirit of friendship:
 if he were to come to harm, I would give my life over to vengeance.
 But so long as my son does 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 come to harm, I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors.
 And as you have asked nothing more of me, I will ask nothing more of you.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then the pale haze vanished, showing an outraged Madam Longbottom being
 blocked from moving forward by the senior Crabbe; her wand was in her hand,
 now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“How 
\emph on
dare
\emph default
 you!” she hissed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lucius's dark robes swirled around him, and his white hair, as he turned
 to the senior Goyle.
 “We return to Malfoy Manor.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There were three pops of Apparition, and they were gone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A silence followed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Dear 
\emph on

\emph default
,” said Madam Longbottom.
 “What was that about?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry shrugged helplessly.
 Then he looked at Neville.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was sweat on Neville's forehead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Thank you very much, Neville,” said Harry.
 “Your help was greatly appreciated, Neville.
 And now, Neville, I think you should sit down.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Yes, General,” said Neville, and instead of coming over to one of the other
 chairs near Harry, he semi-collapsed into a sitting position on the pavement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“You have wrought many changes in my grandson,” said Madam Longbottom.
 “I approve of some, but not others.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Send me the list of which is which,” said Harry.
 “I'll see what I can do.”

Draco looked

very

 His head kept darting around, despite the fact that Draco had insisted
 on them going down into Harry's trunk, and using a true Quieting Charm
 and not just the sound-blurring barrier.

Harry leaned back wearily in the small folding chair that sat at the bottom
 of his trunk's cavern.
 “You know, Draco, just as the fundamental question of rationality is `What
 do I think I know and how do I think I know it?', there's also a cardinal
 sin, a way of thinking that's the opposite of that.
 Like the ancient Greek philosophers.
 They had no clue what was going on, so they'd go around saying things like
 `All is water' or `All is fire', and they never asked themselves, `Wait
 a minute, even if everything 
\emph on

that
