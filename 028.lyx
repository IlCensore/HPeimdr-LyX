\begin_layout Standard
La bianca pillola di zucchero di fronte a Hermione non aveva ancora minimamente
 cambiato forma o colore, anche se lei si era concentrata più intensamente
 di quanto Harry avesse mai visto, i suoi occhi chiusi con forza, gocce

 la bacchetta

Mi sembrava di averlo sentito
\begin_inset Quotes frd

Mi sembrava di averlo sentito iniziare a Trasfigurarsi, appena per un secondo

Harry aveva il groppone in gola.

Probabilmente

 Sembrò voler piangere.

\begin_layout Standard
Lentamente, Harry prese la propria portamina in mano, e prese il foglio
 di carta con tutti gli elementi cancellati, e tracciò una riga sopra l'elemento
 che diceva `

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Non avrebbero potuto somministrare la pillola Trasfigurata a nessuno.
 Ma la Trasfigurazione, almeno del tipo che loro potevano operare, non incantava
 i bersagli -- non potevano Trasfigurare un manico di scopa normale in uno
 volante.
 Quindi se Hermione fosse stata in grado di produrre una pillola, sarebbe
 stata una pillola 
\emph on
non-magica
\emph default
, che avrebbe funzionato per ragioni materiali.
 Avrebbero potuto produrre segretamente delle pillole per un laboratorio
 scientifico babbano, lasciare che 
\emph on
studiassero
\emph default
 le pillole e cercassero di operare un
\emph on
 
\emph default
processo di retro-ingegnerizzazione su di esse prima che la Trasfigurazione
 si consumasse… nessuno, in nessuno dei due mondi, avrebbe avuto bisogno
 di sapere che era coinvolta la magia, sarebbe stato solo un'altra scoperta
 scientifica rivoluzionaria…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Non era il genere di cose a cui un mago avrebbe pensato.
 Non rispettavano sufficientemente le mere 
\emph on
configurazioni di atomi
\emph default
, non pensavano alle cose 
\emph on
materiali
\emph default
 non incantate come strumenti di potere.
 Se non era magico, non era interessante.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Precedentemente, Harry aveva 
\emph on
molto 
\emph default
segretamente -- non l'aveva detto neppure a Hermione -- cercato di Trasfigurare
 nanotecnologia sulle orme di Eric Drexler.
 (Aveva cercato di produrre una nanofabbrica da scrivania, non minuscoli
 assemblatori auto-replicanti.
 Harry non era folle.) Sarebbe stata la condizione di divinità in un solo
 colpo, se avesse funzionato.

\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

Era tutto per oggi, giusto?
\begin_inset Quotes frd
\end_inset

 chiese Hermione.
 Si era accasciata sulla sedia, appoggiando la testa sullo schienale; e
 il suo volto mostrava la sua stanchezza, cosa molto insolita per Hermione.
 Le piaceva fingere di non avere limiti, almeno quando Harry era presente.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

Ancora uno
\begin_inset Quotes frd
\end_inset

, disse Harry con cautela, 
\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

ma questo è piccolo, e per di più potrebbe davvero funzionare.
 L'ho tenuto per ultimo perché speravo che potessimo finire in crescendo.
 È una cosa reale, non come i 
\emph on
phaser
\emph default
.
 Sono stati già realizzati in laboratorio, a differenza della cura per l'Alzheim
er.
 Ed è una sostanza generica, non specifica come i libri perduti di cui hai
 provato a Trasfigurare delle copie.
 Ho disegnato un diagramma della struttura molecolare per mostrartelo.
 Vogliamo solo farlo 
\emph on
più lungo
\emph default
 di quanto non sia mai stato fatto prima, e con tutti i tubi allineati,
 e i terminali immersi in diamanti
\begin_inset Quotes frd
\end_inset

.
 Harry tirò fuori un foglio di carta millimetrata.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hermione si sedette eretta, lo prese e lo studiò, aggottando la fronte.
 
\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

Questi sono 
\emph on
tutti
\emph default
 atomi di carbonio? E Harry, qual è il nome? Non posso Trasfigurarlo se
 non so com'è chiamato
\begin_inset Quotes frd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry fece una faccia disgustata.
 Aveva ancora delle difficoltà ad abituarsi a questo genere di cose, non
 sarebbe dovuto essere importante come qualcosa era 
\emph on
chiamata
\emph default
 se sapevi cosa 
\emph on
era
\emph default
.
 
\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

Sono chiamati 
\emph on
buckytubes
\emph default
 o nanotubi di carbonio.
 Sono un tipo di fullerene che è stato scoperto proprio quest'anno.
 È circa cento volte più forte dell'acciaio a un sesto del peso
\begin_inset Quotes frd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hermione alzò lo sguardo dalla carta millimetrata, l'espressione sorpresa.
 
\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

Ed è 
\emph on
reale?

\begin_inset Quotes frd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

Sì
\begin_inset Quotes frd
\end_inset

, disse Harry, 
\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

solo difficile da realizzare alla maniera babbana.
 Se potessimo ottenerne abbastanza, potremmo usarli per costruire un ascensore
 spaziale fino all'orbita geosincrona o più in alto, e in termini di delta-v
 è a metà strada verso un luogo qualunque del Sistema solare.
 Per di più, potremmo lanciare satelliti per l'energia solare come coriandoli.

\begin_layout Standard
Hermione stava nuovamente aggrottando la fronte.
 
\begin_inset Quotes fld

Questa roba è 
\emph on
sicura?

\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

Non vedo perché non dovrebbe esserlo
\begin_inset Quotes frd
\end_inset

, disse Harry.
 
\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

Un nanotubo è solo un foglio di grafite arrotolato a formare un tubo circolare,
 fondamentalmente, e la grafite è la stessa roba che si usa per le matite

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes fld

\emph on
So
\emph default
 cos'è la grafite, Harry
\begin_inset Quotes frd
\end_inset

, disse Hermione.
 Si pettinò distrattamente all'indietro i capelli, le sopracciglia aggrottate
 mentre osservava il foglio di carta.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry infilò la mano in una tasca delle sue vesti, ed estrasse un filo bianco
 collegato a due piccoli anelli granulari alle estremità.
 Aveva aggiunto gocce di attaccatutto lì dove il filo si univa a ciascun
 anello, per renderlo un unico oggetto che potesse essere Trasfigurato tutto
 insieme.
 Il cianoacrilato, se Harry ricordava bene, funzionava grazie a legami covalenti
, e quella era la cosa più vicina all'essere un 
\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

oggetto solido
\begin_inset Quotes frd
\end_inset

 in un mondo fondamentalmente composto da minuscoli atomi individuali.
 
\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

Quando sei pronta
\begin_inset Quotes frd
\end_inset

, disse Harry, 
\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

prova a Trasfigurare questo in un insieme di fibre di nanotubi allineati
 immersi in due anelli di diamante solido
\begin_inset Quotes frd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

Va bene…
\begin_inset Quotes frd
\end_inset

 Hermione disse lentamente.
 
\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

Harry, ho la sensazione di aver dimenticato qualcosa
\begin_inset Quotes frd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry scosse le spalle impotente.
 
\emph on
Forse sei solo stanca
\emph default
.
 Sapeva bene che era meglio non dirlo ad alta voce, però.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hermione appoggiò la sua bacchetta su uno degli anelli di plastica e lo
 fissò per un po'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due anellini di diamante luccicante giacevano sul tavolo, connessi da un
 lungo filo nero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

È cambiato
\begin_inset Quotes frd
\end_inset

, disse Hermione.
 Suonò come se stesse cercando di essere entusiasta ma avesse finito le
 energie.
 
\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

E ora?
\begin_inset Quotes frd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry si sentì un po' scoraggiato dalla mancanza di passione della sua compagna
 di ricerca, ma fece il possibile per non mostrarlo; forse lo stesso processo
 avrebbe funzionato al contrario per tirarle su il morale.
 
\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

Ora lo metterò alla prova per vedere se sopporta un peso
\begin_inset Quotes frd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
C'era un cavalletto ad `A' che Harry aveva montato per fare un precedente
 esperimento con delle bacchette di diamante -- potevi facilmente realizzare
 degli oggetti di solido diamante, usando la Trasfigurazione, è solo che
 non sarebbero durati.
 L'esperimento precedente aveva misurato se la Trasfigurazione di una bacchetta
 di diamante lunga in una bacchetta di diamante corta le avrebbe permesso
 di sollevare un peso sospeso mentre si contraeva, ovvero se si potesse
 Trasfigurare contro la tensione, cosa che effettivamente si poteva fare.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry inserì attentamente un anello di luccicante diamante sullo spesso
 uncino di metallo alla parte superiore del cavalletto, poi attaccò uno
 spesso gancio di metallo all'anello inferiore, e poi iniziò ad attaccare
 pesi al gancio.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Harry aveva chiesto ai gemelli Weasley di Trasfigurare l'apparato per lui,
 e i gemelli Weasley gli avevano rivolto uno sguardo incredulo, come se
 non riuscissero a immaginare per quale genere di scherzo potesse volere
 quell'oggetto, ma non avevano fatto domande.
 E le loro Trasfigurazioni, a sentir loro, duravano per circa tre ore, quindi
 Harry e Hermione avevano ancora un po' di tempo.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Cento chilogrammi

, Harry disse circa un minuto dopo.
 
\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

Non penso che un filo d'acciaio così sottile ce la farebbe.
 Dovrebbe sopportare ancora di più, ma questo è tutto il peso che ho
\begin_inset Quotes frd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ci fu altro silenzio.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry si raddrizzò, e tornò al tavolo, e si sedette sulla sua sedia, e cerimonio
samente segnò una spunta vicino a `Nanotubi'.
 
\begin_inset Quotes fld

Riuscì a ottenere solo un piccolo ghigno da lei.

\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

Ma Harry, questo è folle, io ho dodici anni, tu undici, è 
\emph on

\emph default
 pensare che scopriremo qualcosa che nessun altro ha mai capito prima
\begin_inset Quotes frd
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

Stai dicendo davvero che dovremmo rinunciare a svelare i segreti della magia
 dopo aver provato per meno di un 
\emph on
mese?
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes frd
\end_inset

 disse Harry, cercando di inserire una sfumatura di sfida nella sua voce.
 In tutta onestà provava lo stesso genere di fatica di Hermione.
 Non una delle 
\emph on
buone
\emph default
 idee aveva mai funzionato.
 Aveva fatto una singola scoperta degna di nota, lo schema mendeliano, e
 non poteva dirlo a Hermione senza infrangere la sua promessa a Draco.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

No
\begin_inset Quotes frd
\end_inset

, disse Hermione.
 Il suo giovane viso sembrava molto serio e adulto.
 
\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

Sto dicendo che in questo momento dovremmo 
\emph on
studiare
\emph default
 tutta la magia che i maghi già conoscono, in modo da poter fare questo
 genere di cose dopo esserci diplomati a Hogwarts
\begin_inset Quotes frd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

Uhm…
\begin_inset Quotes frd
\end_inset

 disse Harry.
 
\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

Hermione, odio metterla in questo modo, ma immagina che decidessimo di sospender
e la nostra ricerca fino ad allora, e la prima cosa che provassimo dopo
 il diploma fosse Trasfigurare una cura per l'Alzheimer, e 
\emph on
funzionasse
\emph default
.
 Ci sentiremmo… non credo che la parola 
\emph on
stupidi
\emph default
 possa descrivere adeguatamente come ci sentiremmo.
 Che succederebbe se ci fosse qualcos'altro di quel genere e funzionasse?
\begin_inset Quotes frd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

Non è 
\emph on

\begin_inset Quotes frd

 disse Hermione.
 La sua voce stava tremando come se fosse sul punto di rompersi in un pianto.
 
\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

Non puoi 
\emph on

\begin_inset Quotes frd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Per un momento Harry si chiese cosa sarebbe successo se qualcuno avesse
 detto a Hermione che lei doveva combattere un Signore Oscuro immortale,
 se si sarebbe trasformata in uno di quegli auto-commiseranti e lamentosi
 eroi di cui Harry non aveva mai sopportato leggere nei libri.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

Ad ogni modo
\begin_inset Quotes frd
\end_inset

, disse Hermione.
 La sua voce vacillò.
 
\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

Non voglio continuare a fare queste cose.
 Non credo che dei bambini possano fare cose che degli adulti non possono
 fare, accade solo nelle storie
\begin_inset Quotes frd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ci fu silenzio nell'aula.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hermione iniziò a sembrare un po' spaventata, e Harry comprese che la propria
 espressione era diventata più fredda.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Non avrebbe fatto tanto male se lo stesso pensiero non fosse già venuto
 a Harry -- che sebbene trent'anni fossero già troppi per un rivoluzionario
 scientifico e venti appena giusti, sebbene ci fossero state persone che
 avevano ottenuto un dottorato a diciassette anni ed eredi quattordicenni
 che erano stati grandi re o generali, non c'era stato proprio nessuno che
 era entrato nei libri di storia a undici anni.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes fld

Va bene

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes fld

Non intendevo questo

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Con uno sforzo, Harry forzò il proprio sguardo lontano da Hermione.
 
\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

Non sono arrabbiato con

\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes frd
\end_inset

, disse Harry.
 La sua voce era fredda, malgrado il suoi migliori sforzi.
 
\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

Sono arrabbiato con, non so, tutto.
 Ma non ho intenzione di perdere, Hermione.
 Perdere non è sempre la cosa giusta da fare.
 Scoprirò come fare qualcosa che un mago adulto non può fare, e poi tornerò
 da te.
 Che ne pensi?

Va bene

 cui avevano lavorato.
 La sua mano si mosse verso la maniglia.

Talvolta Harry odiava avere un lato oscuro, anche quando ci si trovava dentro.

\begin_layout Standard
E la parte di lui che aveva pensato esattamente la stessa cosa di Hermione,

Harry's knuckles had gone white on his wand by the time he stopped trying

And the real eraser wasn't like the picture Harry's brain had of it.
 The idea of the eraser as a

 The real eraser was a collection of atoms held together by electromagnetic

 it.
 Somewhere beyond the veil of Maya, the

truth

 behind Harry's concept of “my wand” was touching the collection of atoms
 that Harry's mind thought of as “a patch on the eraser”, and if that wand

 there was absolutely no reason why it couldn't change the other collection
 too…

When Harry's brain needed to think about the eraser, it would think about

 it was a map-territory confusion, the eraser only existed as a separate

All right, screw this nineteenth-century garbage.

Reality wasn't atoms, it wasn't a set of tiny billiard balls bopping around.
 That was just another lie.
 The notion of atoms as little dots was just another convenient hallucination

 No wonder, then, that his attempts to Transfigure based on that hadn't
 worked.
 If he wanted power, he had to abandon his humanity, and force his thoughts
 to conform to the true math of quantum mechanics.

Then Hermione flinched.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry looked away from her, and started taking slow, deep breaths.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Please don't try to do it alone, Harry,” Hermione said, her voice trembling.
 “Please.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Please don't make me have to decide whether to tell Professor Flitwick.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a long pause.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“So you want us to study,” Harry said.
 She could tell he was trying to keep the anger out of his voice.
 “Just study.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hermione wasn't sure if she should say anything, but… “Like you studied,
 um, timeless physics, right?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry looked back at her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“That thing you did,” Hermione said, her voice tentative, “it wasn't because
 of 
\emph on
our
\emph default
 experiments, right? You could do it because you'd read lots of books.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry opened his mouth, and then he shut it again.
 There was a frustrated look on his face.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“All right,” Harry said.
 “How about this.
 We study, and if I think of anything that seems 
\emph on
really
\emph default
 worth trying, we'll try it after I ask a professor.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Okay,” Hermione said.
 She didn't fall over with relief, but only because she was already sitting
 down.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Shall we get lunch?” Harry said cautiously.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hermione nodded.
 Yes.
 Lunch sounded good.
 For real, this time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She carefully began to push herself off the stone floor, wincing as her
 body screamed at her

\begin_layout Standard
Harry pointed his wand at her and said “

Wingardium Leviosa.

“
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hermione blinked as the huge weight on her legs diminished to something
 bearable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A smile quirked across Harry's face.
 “You can 
\emph on
lift
\emph default
 something without being able to Hover it completely,” he said.
 “Remember that experiment?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hermione smiled back helplessly, although she thought she ought to still
 be angry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And she started walking back toward the Great Hall, feeling remarkably and
 wonderfully light on her feet, as Harry carefully kept his wand trained
 on her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He only managed to keep it up for five minutes, but it was the thought that
 counted.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Minerva looked at Dumbledore.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dumbledore gazed back inquiringly at her.
 “Did you understand any of that?” the Headmaster said, sounding bemused.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It had been the most complete and utter gibberish that Minerva could ever
 remember hearing.
 She was feeling a bit embarrassed about having summoned the Headmaster
 to hear it, but she'd been given explicit instructions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I'm afraid not,” Professor McGonagall said primly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“So,” Dumbledore said.
 The silver beard swung away from her, the old wizard's twinkling gaze looked
 elsewhere once more.
 “You suspect you might be able to do something that other wizards can't
 do, something we think is impossible.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The three of them stood within the Headmaster's private Transfiguration
 workroom, where the shining phoenix of Dumbledore's Patronus had told her
 to bring Harry, moments after her own Patronus had reached him.
 Light shone down through the skylights and illuminated the great seven-pointed
 alchemical diagram drawn in the center of the circular room, showing it
 to be a little dusty, which saddened Minerva.
 Transfiguration research was one of Dumbledore's great enjoyments, and
 she'd known how pressed for time he'd been lately, but not that he was
 
\emph on
this
\emph default
 pressed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And now Harry Potter was going to waste even more of the Headmaster's time.
 But she certainly couldn't blame 
\emph on
Harry
\emph default
 for that.
 He'd done the proper thing in coming to her to say that he'd had an idea
 for doing something in Transfiguration that was currently believed to be
 impossible, and she herself had done exactly what she'd been told to do:
 she'd ordered Harry to be quiet and not discuss anything with her until
 she had consulted the Headmaster and they'd finished moving to a secure
 location.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If Harry had started out by saying what 
\emph on
specifically
\emph default
 he thought he could do, she wouldn't have bothered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Look, I know it's hard to explain,” Harry said, sounding a little embarrassed.
 “What it adds up to is that what you believe conflicts with what scientists
 believe, in a case where I'd genuinely expect scientists to know more than
 wizards.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Minerva would have sighed out loud, if Dumbledore hadn't seemed to be taking
 the whole thing very seriously.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry's idea stemmed from simple ignorance, nothing more.
 If you changed half of a metal ball into glass, the 
\emph on
whole ball
\emph default
 had a different Form.
 To change the part 
\emph on
was
\emph default
 to change the whole, and that meant removing the whole Form and replacing
 it with a different one.
 What would it even 
\emph on
mean
\emph default
 to Transfigure only half of a metal ball? That the metal ball 
\emph on
as a whole
\emph default
 had the same Form as before, but 
\emph on
half
\emph default
 that ball now had a different Form?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Mr.
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

Potter,” said Professor McGonagall, “what you want to do isn't just impossible,
 it's 
\emph on
illogical.

\emph default
 If you change half of something, you 
\emph on
did
\emph default
 change the whole.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Indeed,” said Dumbledore.
 “But Harry is the hero, so he may be able to do things that are logically
 impossible.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Minerva would have rolled her eyes, if she hadn't gone numb a long time
 ago.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Supposing it 
\emph on
was
\emph default
 possible,” said Dumbledore, “can you think of any reason why the results
 would differ in any way from ordinary Transfiguration?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Minerva frowned.
 The fact that the concept was literally unimaginable was presenting her
 with some difficulty, but she tried to take it at face value.
 A Transfiguration imposed on only half of a metal ball…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Strange things happening at the interface?” said Minerva.
 “But that should be no different than Transfiguring the object as a whole,
 into a Form with two different parts…”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dumbledore nodded.
 “That is my own thought as well.
 And Harry, if your theory is correct, it implies that what you want to
 do is 
\emph on
exactly
\emph default
 like any other Transfiguration, only applied to a part of the subject rather
 than the whole? No changes 
\emph on
at all?
\emph default
”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Yes,” Harry said firmly.
 “That's the whole point.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dumbledore looked at her again.
 “Minerva, can you think of any reason whatsoever why that would be dangerous?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“No,” said Minerva, after she had finished searching through her memory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Likewise myself,” said the Headmaster.
 “All right, then, since this ought to be exactly analogous to ordinary
 Transfiguration in all respects, and since we cannot think of any reason
 whatsoever why it would be dangerous, I think that the second degree of
 caution will suffice.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Minerva was surprised, but she didn't object.
 Dumbledore was by far her senior in Transfiguration, and he had tried literally
 thousands of new Transfigurations without ever choosing a degree of caution
 that was too low.
 He had used Transfiguration 
\emph on
in combat
\emph default
 and he was 
\emph on
still alive.

\emph default
 If the Headmaster thought the second degree was enough, it was enough.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That Harry was certainly going to fail was, of course, completely irrelevant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The two of them started setting up the wards and detection webs.
 The most important web was the one that checked to make sure no Transfigured
 material had entered the air.
 Harry would be enclosed in a separate shell of force with its own air supply
 just to be certain, only his wand allowed to leave the shield, and the
 interface tight.
 They were inside Hogwarts so they couldn't automatically Apparate out any
 material that showed signs of spontaneous combustion, but they could launch
 it out a skylight almost as fast, the windows all folded outward for exactly
 that reason.
 Harry himself would go out a different skylight at the first sign of trouble.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry watched them working, his face looking a little frightened.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Don't worry,” said Professor McGonagall in the middle of her running descriptio
n, “this almost certainly won't be necessary, Mr.
\begin_inset ERT

\end_inset

Potter.
 If we 
\emph on
expected
\emph default
 anything to go wrong you would not be allowed to try.
 It's just ordinary precautions for any Transfiguration no one has ever
 tried before.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry swallowed and nodded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And a few minutes later, Harry was strapped into the safety chair and resting
 his wand against a metal ball 
\begin_inset ERT

 one that, based on his current test scores, should have been too large
 for him to Transfigure in less than thirty minutes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And a few minutes after 
\emph on
that,
\emph default
 Minerva was leaning against the wall, feeling faint.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a small patch of glass on the ball where Harry's wand had rested.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry didn't say 
\emph on
I told you so,
\emph default
 but the smug look on his sweating face said it for him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dumbledore was casting analytic Charms on the ball, looking more and more
 intrigued by the moment.
 Thirty years had melted off his face.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Fascinating,” said Dumbledore.
 “It's exactly as he claimed.
 He simply Transfigured a part of the subject without Transfiguring the
 whole.
 You say it's really just a conceptual limitation, Harry?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Yes,” Harry said, “but a deep one, just knowing it had to be a conceptual
 limitation wasn't enough.
 I had to suppress the part of my mind that was making the error and think
 instead about the underlying reality that scientists figured out.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Truly fascinating,” Dumbledore said.
 “I take it that for any other wizard to do the same would require months
 of study if they could do it at all? And may I ask you to partially Transfigure
 some other subjects?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Probably yes and of course,” Harry said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Half an hour later, Minerva was feeling equally bewildered, but considerably
 reassured about the safety issues.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It 
\emph on
was
\emph default
 the same, aside from being logically impossible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I believe that's enough, Headmaster,” Minerva said finally.
 “I suspect partial Transfiguration is more tiring than the ordinary sort.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Getting less so with practice,” said the exhausted and pale boy, voice
 unsteady, “but yeah, you've got that right.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The process of extracting Harry from the wards took another minute, and
 then Minerva escorted him to a much more comfortable chair, and Dumbledore
 produced an ice-cream soda.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“
\emph on
Congratulations
\emph default
, Mr.
\begin_inset ERT

\end_layout

\end_inset

Potter!” said Professor McGonagall, and meant it.
 She would have bet almost anything against that working.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Congratulations indeed,” said Dumbledore.
 “Even I did not make any original discoveries in Transfiguration before
 the age of fourteen.
 Not since the day of Dorotea Senjak has any genius flowered so early.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Thanks,” Harry said, sounding a little surprised.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Nonetheless,” Dumbledore said thoughtfully, “I think it would be most wise
 to keep this happy event a secret, at least for now.
 Harry, did you discuss your idea with any other person before you spoke
 to Professor McGonagall?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was silence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Um…” Harry said.
 “I don't want to turn anyone over to the Inquisition, but I did tell one
 other student 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The word almost exploded from Professor McGonagall's lips.
 “
\emph on
What?
\emph default
 You discussed a completely novel form of Transfiguration with a 
\emph on
student
\emph default
 before consulting a recognized authority? Do you have any idea how 
\emph on
irresponsible
\emph default
 that was?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I'm sorry,” said Harry.
 “I didn't realize.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The boy looked appropriately frightened, and Minerva felt something inside
 her relax.
 At least Harry understood how foolish he'd been.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“You must swear Miss Granger to secrecy,” Dumbledore said gravely.
 “And do not tell anyone else unless there is an extremely good reason for
 it, and they too have sworn.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Ah… why?” Harry said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Minerva was wondering the same thing.
 Once again the Headmaster was thinking too far ahead for her to keep up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Because you can do something that no one else will believe you can do,”
 Dumbledore said.
 “Something completely unexpected.
 It may prove to be your critical advantage, Harry, and we must preserve
 it.
 Please, trust me in this.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor McGonagall nodded, her firm face showing nothing of her inner
 confusion.
 “Please do, Mr.
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

Potter,” she said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“All right…” Harry said slowly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Once we have finished examining your materials,” Dumbledore added, “you
 may practice partial Transfiguration, on glass to steel and steel to glass
 
\emph on
only
\emph default
, with Miss Granger to act as your spotter.
 Naturally, if either of you suspect any symptom of any form of Transfiguration
 sickness, inform a professor at once.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Just before Harry left the workroom, with his hand on the doorhandle, the
 boy turned back and said, “As long as we're here, have either of you noticed
 anything different about Professor Snape?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Different?” said the Headmaster.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Minerva didn't let her wry smile show on her face.
 Of course the boy was apprehensive about the `evil Potions Master', since
 he had no way of knowing why Severus was to be trusted.
 It would have been odd to say the least, explaining to Harry that Severus
 was still in love with his mother.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I mean, has his behavior changed recently in any way?” said Harry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Not that I have seen…” the Headmaster said slowly.
 “Why do you ask?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry shook his head.
 “I don't want to prejudice your own observations by saying.
 Just keep an eye out, maybe?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That sent a quiver of unease through Minerva in a way that no outright accusatio
n of Severus could have.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry bowed to both of them respectfully, and took his leave.

know
\emph default
 to take Harry seriously? I would have thought his idea merely impossible!”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The old wizard's face turned grave.
 “The same reason it must be kept secret, Minerva.
 The same reason I told you to come to me, if Harry made any such claim.
 Because it is a power that Voldemort knows not.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The words took a few seconds to sink in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then the cold shiver went down her spine, as it always did when she
 remembered.

“Perhaps not, then,” Dumbledore said after Minerva tried to explain.
 “I confess I had been hoping for something that would help in finding Voldemort
's horcrux, wherever he may have hidden it.
 But…” The old wizard shrugged.
 “Prophecies are tricky things, Minerva, and it is best to take no chances.

“There I have no idea,” sighed Dumbledore.
 “Unless Harry is making a move against Severus, and thought that an open
 question might be taken seriously where a direct allegation would be dismissed.
 And if that was indeed what happened, Harry correctly reasoned that I would
 not trust that it was so.
 Let us simply keep watch, without prejudice, as he asks.”

Alissa Cornfoot's eyes were slightly glazed as she gazed upon the Potions
 Master giving her class a stern lecture, holding up a tiny bronze bean
 and saying something about screaming puddles of human flesh.
 Ever since the start of this year she'd been having trouble listening in
 Potions.
 She kept staring at their awful, mean, greasy professor and fantasizing
 about special detentions.
 There was probably something really 
\emph on
wrong
\emph default
 with her but she just couldn't seem to stop doing it

“Ow!” Alissa said then.

\begin_layout Standard
Snape had just flicked the bronze bean unerringly at Alissa's forehead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Miss Cornfoot,” said the Potions Master, his voice cutting, “this is a
 delicate potion and if you cannot pay attention you will hurt your classmates,
 not just yourself.
 See me after class.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last four words didn't help her any, but she tried harder, and managed
 to get through the day without melting anyone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After class, Alissa approached the desk.
 Part of her wanted to stand there meekly with her face abashed and her
 hands clasped penitently behind her back, just in case, but some quiet
 instinct told her this might be a 
\emph on
bad idea
\emph default
.
 So instead she just stood there with her face neutral, in a posture that
 was very proper for a young lady, and said, “Professor?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Miss Cornfoot,” Snape said without looking up from the sheets he was grading,
 “I do not return your affections, I begin to find your stares disturbing,
 and you will restrain your eyes henceforth.
 Is that quite clear?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Yes,” said Alissa in a strangled squeak, and Snape dismissed her, and she
 fled the classroom with her cheeks flaming like molten lava.
