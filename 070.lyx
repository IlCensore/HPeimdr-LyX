Dovrei anche notare, Albus, che il racconto riferito dalla signorina Granger
 sul tuo atteggiamento apparentemente di scarso aiuto -- credo che la sua
 frase fosse `ha detto che dovrei essere contenta di essere solo una comprimaria

Ora so che non intendevi realmente scoraggiare la ragazza.
 Tutto il contrario, in effetti.
 Ma tu e Severus mi avete spesso detto che per mantenere un segreto non
 devo reagire in maniera differente da come farebbe qualcuno veramente all'oscur

 Quindi non ho avuto altra scelta che confermare che il racconto della signorina
 Granger era preciso, e fingere l'appropriato livello di preoccupazione,
 con un leggero sottinteso di offesa.
 Dopo tutto, se

Non c'era molto spazio tra le mura di pietra che delimitavano il vestibolo
 dell'ufficio del preside, quindi anche se molte persone avevano espresso
 il desidero di assistere alla protesta, non molte erano state autorizzate
 a venire.
 Giusto la professoressa Sinistra e la professoressa Vector, che indossavano
 le spille, e i prefetti Penelope Clearwater e Rose Brown e Jacqueline Preece,
 che indossavano le spille.
 Dietro di

 che non indossavano le spille, stavano scrutando la situazione.
 Harry Potter e il Caposcuola di Hogwarts erano lì, e i prefetti Percy Weasley
 e Oliver Beatson, tutti che indossavano le spille come manifestazione di
 Solidarietà.
 E ovviamente gli otto membri fondatori della

E il professor Quirrell, che stava appoggiato con la schiena contro il muro
 di pietra più distante e osservava con occhi indecifrabili.
 Il Professore di Difesa aveva ottenuto una delle spille di Hermione, sebbene
 ella non gliene avesse mai venduta una; e non la stava indossando, ma svogliata
mente lanciandola in aria con una mano.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Quest'intera faccenda era sembrata un'idea molto migliore quattro giorni

Ma doveva perseverare, perché questo era quello che gli eroi facevano, persevera
vano, e anche perché era sembrato infinitamente tremendo dire a tutti che
 stava annullando tutto.
 Hermione si chiese quanto eroismo era andato avanti per ragioni simili.
 La maggior parte dei libri non

E si rifiutarono di arrendersi, indipendentemente da quanto sarebbe stato

; ma gran parte della storia aveva molto più senso in quel modo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alle 19:15, le aveva detto la professoressa McGonagall, il preside Silente
 sarebbe sceso a parlare loro per un paio di minuti.
 La professoressa McGonagall aveva detto di non spaventarsi -- nel profondo
 il Preside era una persona buona, e loro avevano correttamente ottenuto
 l'autorizzazione della scuola per la protesta.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ma Hermione era molto, molto cosciente che anche se lo stava facendo con
 un permesso firmato, stava comunque Sfidando l'Autorità.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dopo aver deciso di essere un eroe, Hermione aveva fatto la cosa più ovvia,
 ed era andata alla biblioteca di Hogwarts e aveva preso i libri su come
 essere un eroe.
 Poi aveva rimesso quei libri di nuovo sui loro scaffali, perché era stato
 chiaramente scontato che nessuno degli autori era stato un eroe vero e
 proprio.
 Invece aveva semplicemente letto cinque volte, fino a quando ne aveva imparato
 a memoria ogni parola, i trenta centimetri di saggio scritti da Godric
 Grifondoro, che costituivano per intero la sua autobiografia e i suoi consigli
 di una vita.
 (O meglio, la loro traduzione in inglese; non poteva ancora leggere il
 latino.) L'autobiografia di Godric Grifondoro era stata molto più

compressa
\emph default
 rispetto ai libri Hermione era abituata a leggere, aveva usato

una frase

 per dire cose che da sole avrebbero dovuto prendere trenta centimetri,
 e poi c'era

un'altra

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ma era chiaro da quello che aveva letto che, sebbene Sfidare l'Autorità
 non fosse il

senso
\emph default
 dell'essere un eroe, non si poteva essere un eroe se si era troppo spaventati
 per farlo.
 E ormai Hermione Granger sapeva come gli altri la vedevano, e sapeva quello
 che gli altri pensavano che non avrebbe potuto fare.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hermione sollevò il suo cartello di protesta un po' più in alto e si concentrò

There was a short, sardonic laugh from the direction of Professor Quirrell.
 When Hermione turned her head to look she saw that the Defense Professor
 was still idly toying with the button, not bothering to glance up at the
 rest of them, as he said, “Such is human nature, Miss Clearwater.
 Rest assured that

A cold chuckle.
 “I suspect it happens more often than any dare suggest, in the proudest
 pureblood families.
 Some lonely witch spies a handsome Muggle; and thinks how very easy it
 would be, to slip the man a love potion, and by him be adored alone and
 utterly.
 And since she knows he can offer her no resistance, why, it is only natural
 for her to take from him whatever she pleases

 “Although personally, I don't.”

There was a bit of silence, for a time.

 it had slipped down to her shoulder while she was listening.
 She'd never thought of that, not even a little, and now she was trying
 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 to think of it, and her stomach was feeling a bit queasy.
 She looked in Harry Potter's direction, not quite knowing why she did;
 and she saw that Harry's face was perfectly still.
 A chill ran down her spine before she looked away, not quite fast enough
 to miss the small nod that Harry gave her, as though they were agreeing
 on something.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“To be fair,” Professor Sinistra said after a while, “since I received my
 Hogwarts letter I can't recall encountering any prejudice on account of
 being a woman, or colored.
 No, now it is all for being a Muggleborn.
 I believe Miss Granger said that it was
\emph on
 just
\emph default
 with heroes that she found a problem, so far?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It took Hermione a moment to recognize that she'd been asked the question,
 and then she said “Yes,” in a tone that squeaked a little.
 This whole thing had blown up a bit larger than she'd imagined when she'd
 started it.

\begin_layout Standard
“What exactly did you check, Miss Granger?” said Professor Vector.
 She looked older than Professor Sinistra, her hair starting to gray a little;
 Hermione hadn't ever come close to Professor Vector in person until the
 Arithmancy Professor had asked her for a button.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Um,” Hermione said, her voice a little high, “I checked the history books
 and there's been as many woman Ministers of Magic as men.
 Then I looked at Supreme Mugwumps and there were a few more wizards than
 witches but not many.
 But if you look at people like famous Dark Wizard hunters, or people who've
 stopped invasions of Dark creatures, or people who've overthrown Dark Lords

 They are similar career paths followed by similar people, and one can hardly

 its reflection.”

“Oh, 
\emph on
now
\emph default
 I see!” said Tracey Davis, speaking up so suddenly that Hermione gave a
 small startle.
 “You're joining our protest because you're worried that not enough girls
 are becoming Dark Witches!” Then Tracey giggled, which Hermione couldn't
 have managed at this point if you paid her a million pounds sterling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a half-smile on Professor Quirrell's face as he replied, “Not
 really, Miss Davis.
 In truth I do not care about that sort of thing in the slightest.
 But it is futile to count the witches among Ministers of Magic and other
 such ordinary folk leading ordinary existences, when Grindelwald and Dumbledore
 and He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named were all men.” The Defense Professor's fingers
 idly spun the button, turning it over and over.
 “Then again, only a very few folk ever do anything interesting with their
 lives.
 What does it matter to you if 
\emph on
they
\emph default
 are mostly witches or mostly wizards, so long as 
\emph on
you
\emph default

 for although you are ambitious, you have no ambition.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“

That's not true!
\emph default
” said Tracey indignantly.
 “And what's it mean?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor Quirrell straightened from where he had been leaning against the
 wall.
 “You were Sorted into Slytherin, Miss Davis, and I expect that you will
 grasp at any opportunity for advancement which falls into your hands.
 But there is no great ambition that you are driven to accomplish, and you
 will not 
\emph on
make
\emph default
 your opportunities.
 At best you will grasp your way upward into Minister of Magic, or some
 other high position of unimportance, never breaking the bounds of your
 existence.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then Professor Quirrell's gaze shifted away from Tracey, he was looking
 at

her,

 the pale blue eyes staring at her with an awful intensity

 that Harry had laid his hand on Professor Flitwick's shoulder and was shaking
 his head, face looking very adult.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hermione felt like a deer caught in headlights.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“What drove you to break your bounds, Miss Granger?” said the Defense Professor,
 still gazing directly at her.
 “Why is getting good marks in class no longer enough? Is it true greatness
 that you seek? Does some aspect of the world dissatisfy you, that you must
 remake according to your will? Or is this all merely a child's game to
 you? I will be quite disappointed if this is only about rivaling Harry

\begin_layout Standard
“You may take a moment to think, if you like,” said Professor Quirrell.
 “Pretend it is a homework essay, six inches due Thursday.
 I hear you are quite eloquent in them.”

 “I don't agree with one single thing you just said, anywhere.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Well spoken,” came Professor McGonagall's crisp voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor Quirrell's gaze did not waver.
 “That is not six inches, Miss Granger.
 
\emph on
Something
\emph default
 drives you to defy the Headmaster's verdict and gather followers about
 yourself.
 Perhaps it is something you prefer not to speak aloud?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hermione knew the correct answer wouldn't impress Professor Quirrell, but
 it was the correct answer, so she said it.
 “I don't think you need ambition to be a hero,” Hermione said.
 Her voice wavered but it didn't crack.
 “I think you just have to do what's right.
 And they're not my followers, we're friends.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor Quirrell leaned back against the wall again.
 The half-smile had faded from his face.
 “Most folk tell themselves they are doing right, Miss Granger.
 They do not thereby rise above the ordinary.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hermione took a couple of deep breaths, trying to be brave.
 “It's not

 “But I think if someone just tries to do what's right, over and over again,

A rumbling noise filled the small stone vestibule, and Hermione, her nerves

 as her other hand darted toward her wand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The gargoyles were stepping aside, the Flowing Stone rumbling like rock
 as it moved like flesh.
 The huge ugly figures waited only briefly, dead gray eyes staring out in
 silent vigil.
 Then the great gargoyles folded their wings back into place and stepped
 back into their former positions, the Flowing Stone not changing its outward
 appearance at all as it returned from flexibility to motionlessness, and
 the brief gap in the stone of Hogwarts was solid once more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And before them all, wearing robes of bright purple that probably only looked
 hideous if you were Muggleborn, stood the towering form of Albus Percival
 Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, the Headmaster of Hogwarts, the Chief Warlock
 of the Wizengamot, the Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation
 of Wizards, the vanquisher of the Dark Lord Grindelwald and protector of
 Britain, the rediscoverer of the fabled Twelve Uses of Dragon's Blood,
 the most powerful wizard alive; and he was looking at 
\emph on
her,
\emph default
 Hermione Jean Granger, General of the recently expanded Sunshine Regiment,
 who was getting the best grades in the first year of Hogwarts classes,
 and who had declared herself a heroine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even her

name

 was shorter than his.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Headmaster smiled benevolently at her, his wrinkle-lined eyes twinkling
 cheerfully beneath their half-circles of glass, and said, “Hello, Miss
 Granger.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The odd thing was that it wasn't nearly as scary as talking to Professor
 Quirrell.
 “Hello, Headmaster Dumbledore,” Hermione said with only a slight quaver
 in her voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Miss Granger,” said Dumbledore, now looking more serious, “I think you
 and I may have had a bit of a misunderstanding.
 I did not mean to imply that you could not, or should not be a hero.
 I certainly did not mean to imply that witches in general should not be
 heroes.
 Only that you were… a bit young, to be thinking of such things.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hermione, unable to help herself, glanced at Professor McGonagall and saw
 that Professor McGonagall was giving her an encouraging smile 
\begin_inset ERT

 or she was giving the two of them

some

\begin_inset ERT

\end_inset

 so Hermione looked back at the Headmaster and said, the small quaver in
 her voice a little larger now, “Since you became Headmaster forty years
 ago, there've been eleven students to graduate Hogwarts who became heroes,
 I mean people like Lupe Cazaril and so on, and 
\emph on
ten
\emph default
 of those were boys.
 Cimorene Linderwall was the only witch.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Hm,” said the Headmaster.
 There was a thoughtful expression on his face; he at least 
\emph on
seemed
\emph default
 to be thinking about it.
 “Miss Granger, I have never been one for tallying such numbers.
 Often it is too much easier to count than to understand.
 Many good people have come out of Hogwarts, witches and wizards both; those
 famed as heroes are only one kind of good person, and perhaps not the highest.
 You did not include Alice Longbottom or Lily Potter in your reckoning…
 But leave that aside.
 Tell me, Miss Granger, did you tally how many heroes came out of Hogwarts
 in the forty years before me? For in that time I can recall only three
 now called heroes; and among those three, no witches at all.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I'm not trying to say it's 
\emph on
just
\emph default
 you!” Hermione said.
 “Only I think maybe a 
\emph on
lot
\emph default
 of people, like the Headmasters before you too, maybe even your whole society
 and everything, might be discouraging girls.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The old wizard sighed.
 His half-glasses eyes looked only at her, as though they were the only
 two people present.
 “Miss Granger, it might be possible to discourage witches from becoming
 Charms Mistresses, or Quidditch players, or even Aurors.
 But not heroes.
 If someone is meant to be a hero then a hero they will be.
 They will walk through fire and swim through ice.
 Dementors will not stop them, nor the deaths of friends, and not discouragement
 either.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Well,” Hermione said, and paused, struggling with the words.
 “Well, I mean… what if that's not 
\emph on
actually
\emph default
 true? I mean, to 
\emph on
me
\emph default
 it seems that if you want more witches to be heroes, you ought to teach
 them heroing.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Many boys and girls are heroes in their dreams,” Dumbledore said quietly.
 He did not look at any of the other girls, only at her.
 “Fewer in the waking world.
 Many have stood their ground and faced the darkness when it comes for them.
 Fewer come for the darkness and force it to face them.
 It is a hard life, sometimes lonely, often short.
 I have told none to refuse that calling, but neither would I wish to increase
 their number.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hermione hesitated; there was something in the lined face that stopped her,
 like a hint to all the emotion that wasn't being displayed, years and years
 of it…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
 Maybe if there were more heroes, their lives wouldn't be so lonely, or
 so short.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She couldn't bring herself to say that, though, not to him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“But the point is moot,” said the old wizard.
 He smiled, a bit ruefully she thought.
 “Miss Granger, you cannot teach heroism like you would teach Charms.
 You cannot assign twelve inches on how to carry on when all hope seems
 lost.
 You cannot rehearse students on when to stand up and tell the Headmaster
 he has done wrong.
 Heroes are born, not taught.
 And for whatever reason, more of them are born boys than girls.” The Headmaster
 shrugged, as if to say that
\emph on
 he
\emph default
 was helpless to do anything about that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Um,” Hermione said.
 She couldn't help it, she glanced behind her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor Sinistra was looking a bit indignant.
 And it
\emph on
 wasn't
\emph default
 true that everyone was staring at her like she'd just been silly, the way
 she'd started to imagine while she was listening to Dumbledore.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hermione turned back to face Dumbledore again, took a deep breath, and said,
 “Well, maybe people who are going to be heroes, will be heroes no matter
 what.
 But I don't see how anyone could really 
\emph on
know
\emph default
 that, aside from just saying it afterward.
 And when 
\emph on
I
