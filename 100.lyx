 Filch appariva contorto alla luce della lampada a olio che egli reggeva,
 le ombre che danzavano sul suo volto.
 Dietro di loro le porte di Hogwarts si allontanavano rapidamente, e i terreni
 scuri si facevano più vicini.
 La pista che ora seguivano camminando era fangosa e indistinta.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gli alberi, i rami precedentemente nudi per l'inverno, non erano ancora
 completamente ricoperti dalla primavera; le loro diramazioni si allungavano
 verso il cielo come dita slanciate, scheletri visibili in mezzo al magro
 fogliame.
 La luna era luminosa, ma le nuvole che le solcavano il cielo davanti li
 gettavano spesso nell'oscurità, illuminati solo dalle fiamme fioche della
 lampada di Filch.

Draco teneva una stretta ferma sulla propria bacchetta.

Dove ci sta portando?
\begin_inset Quotes frd
\end_inset

 disse Tracey Davis.
 Era stata sorpresa insieme a Draco da Filch, mentre si recavano ad un tentato
 incontro dei Serpeverde d'Argento dopo l'ora del coprifuoco, e similmente
 aveva ricevuto una punizione.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

Voi seguitemi e basta
\begin_inset Quotes frd
\end_inset

, disse Argus Filch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Draco si stava sentendo piuttosto infastidito dall'intera faccenda.
 I Serpeverde d'Argento sarebbero dovuti essere un affare scolastico riconosciut
o.
 Non c'era ragione per cui una cospirazione segreta non avrebbe dovuto avere
 il permesso di incontrarsi dopo il coprifuoco, se era per il bene superiore
 di Hogwarts.
 Se quello fosse accaduto ancora una volta egli avrebbe parlato con Daphne
 Greengrass e Daphne avrebbe parlato a suo padre e allora Filch avrebbe
 imparato la saggezza nel guardare dall'altra parte quando erano coinvolti
 i Malfoy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Le luci del castello di Hogwarts si erano attenuate in lontananza quando
 Filch parlò di nuovo.
 
\begin_inset Quotes fld

Scommetto che ci penserete due volte a infrangere ancora una regola scolastica,

\begin_inset Quotes frd

 Filch girò la testa, allontanandola dalla lampada, in modo da poter sbirciare
 malevolmente i quattro studenti che lo seguivano.

\begin_layout Standard
Draco non stava prestando attenzione.
 Semplicemente Filch non era dello stesso livello di Amycus Carrow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dietro di loro, una dei due Serpeverde più grandi che li seguiva fece un
 risolino, sebbene non disse nulla.
 Al suo fianco c'era l'altro, un ragazzo alto con un'impronta slava sul
 suo volto, e che parlava ancora con un accento.
 Erano stati sorpresi per un'infrazione indipendente, che aveva a che fare
 col genere di cose di cui Tracey continuava a parlare, e sembravano essere
 nel loro terzo o quarto anno.
 
\begin_inset Quotes fld

\begin_layout Standard
Argus Filch rimase in silenzio per mezzo minuto, come se stesse cercando
 di pensare a una replica appropriata, e poi fece una risatina.
 
\begin_inset Quotes fld

\begin_inset Quotes frd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Davanti a loro c'era una casetta con le finestre illuminate, sebbene le
 proporzioni sembrassero sbagliate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Filch fischiò, un suono acuto e tagliente, e un cane iniziò ad abbaiare.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dalla casetta uscì una figura, che fece sembrare gli alberi troppo piccoli
 attorno a lei.
 La figura era seguita da un cane che appariva come un cucciolo in confronto,
 finché non lo si guardava separatamente dalla sagoma più alta e si comprendeva
 che il cane era enorme, più simile a un lupo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gli occhi di Draco si socchiusero, prima che potesse accorgersene.
 In quanto Serpeverde d'Argento non avrebbe dovuto avere pregiudizi contro
 esseri senzienti, specialmente non là dove altre persone potevano vederlo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

Che roba è?
\begin_inset Quotes frd
\end_inset

 disse la figura, nella rumorosa voce roca del mezzo-gigante.
 Il suo ombrello si accese di un bagliore bianco, più luminoso della fioca
 lampada di Flich.
 Nell'altra mano reggeva una balestra; una faretra di corti dardi era legata
 alla parte superiore del braccio.

\begin_layout Standard
L'enorme mezzo-gigante era accigliato.
 
\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

Argus, ciavevo pensato a te e qualche settimino.
 È inutile portarci aiuti se devo stare attento a loro tutto il tempo
\begin_inset Quotes frd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Il volto di Argus si illuminò di crudele soddisfazione.
 
\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

Questi sono affari loro, no? Avrebbero dovuto pensare ai loro lupi mannari
 prima di ficcarsi nei guai, no? Mandali fuori da soli.
 Non sarei così amico con loro, Hagrid.
 Sono qui per essere puniti, dopo tutto
\begin_inset Quotes frd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Il mezzo-gigante emise un massiccio sospiro (suonò come se un uomo normale
 avesse avuta tutta l'aria cacciata via dai polmoni da una Fattura di Randellame

 la sua lampada che andava su e giù nell'oscurità.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

Vabbé

\begin_layout Standard
Li condusse all'esatto limitare della Foresta.
 Tenendo alta la sua lampada indicò in basso verso una pista stretta e serpeggia
nte di terra che scompariva tra i fitti alberi neri.
 Una leggera brezza soffiava sopra la testa di Draco mentre guardava nella
 Foresta.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset

C'è quaccheccosa là che sta magnando unicorni
\begin_inset Quotes frd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Draco annuì: ricordava vagamente di aver sentito qualcosa di simile un paio
 di settimane prima, verso la fine di aprile.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

Ci ha chiamati per scovare una scia di sangue argenteo fino a un unicorno

 disse eccitata Tracey.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

No
\begin_inset Quotes frd

, disse Draco, sebbene riuscì a fermare il sogghigno di riflesso.
 
\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

Filch ci ha dato la nota di punizione oggi a pranzo, a mezzogiorno.
 Il signor Hagrid non aspetterebbe così tanto per trovare un unicorno ferito,
 e se stessimo cercando una cosa simile, cercheremmo di giorno, quanto è
 illuminato.
 Allora
\begin_inset Quotes frd
\end_inset

, Draco sollevò un dito, come aveva visto fare all'ispettore León negli
 spettacoli, 
\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes fld

Non sei come ti pensavo, Draco Malfoy.
 Proprio per niente come ti pensavo.
 E tu sei Tracey Davis, allora.
 Ho sentito di te.
 Una del gruppo della povera signorina Granger
\begin_inset Quotes frd
\end_inset

.
 Rubeus Hagrid guardò verso i due Serpeverde più grandi, scrutandoli alla
 luce del suo ombrello luminoso.
 
\begin_inset Quotes fld

 Il ragazzo più grande annuì, un sorriso leggermente sprezzante adagiato
 sul suo volto.

Cosa potrebbe uccidere gli unicorni?
\begin_inset Quotes frd

 disse Draco dopo che avevano camminato per qualche minuto.
 Draco conosceva qualcosa delle creature Oscure, ma non poteva ricordare
 nulla che fosse noto per cibarsi di unicorni.
 
\begin_inset Quotes fld

Che genere di creatura fa una cosa simile, qualcuno lo sa?

\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

Signorina Davis?
\begin_inset Quotes frd

 disse Draco, e quando ella lo guardò, egli puntò silenziosamente un dito
 verso la luna.
 Era crescente gibbosa, ma non ancora piena.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

Oh, giusto

, disse Tracey.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

No mannari nella Foresta

\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

Sono normali maghi quasi tutto il tempo, ricordate.
 Non possono essere nemmanco lupi, non sono abbastanza veloci da acchiappare

 Potenti creature magiche, sono gli unicorni, mai saputo di qualcuno che
 potesse fare male loro prima
\begin_inset Quotes frd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Draco listened to this, thinking about the puzzle almost despite himself.
 “Then what 
\emph on
is
\emph default
 fast enough to catch a unicorn?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Wouldn't `ave been a matter of speed,” Hagrid said, giving Draco an indeciphera
ble glance.
 “Ere's no end ter the ways that creatures hunt.
 Poison, darkness, traps.
 Imps as can't be seen or heard or remembered, even while they're eatin'
 yer face.
 Always summat new an' wonderful to learn.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A cloud passed over the moon, casting the forest into shadow lit only by
 the glow of Hagrid's umbrella.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Meself,” Hagrid continued, “I think we might `ave a Parisian hydra on our
 `ands.
 They're no threat to a wizard, yeh've just got to keep holdin' `em off
 long enough, and there's no way yeh can lose.
 I mean literally no way yeh can lose so long's yeh keep fightin'.
 Trouble is, against a Parisian hydra, most creatures give up long before.
 Takes a while to cut down all the heads, yeh see.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Bah,” said the foreign boy.
 “In Durmstrang we learn to fight Buchholz hydra.
 Unimaginably more tedious to fight! I mean literally, cannot imagine.
 First-years not believe us when we tell them winning is possible! Instructor
 must give second order, iterate until they comprehend.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the Forest,
 until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were
 so thick.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then Draco saw it, thick splashes on the roots of trees, gleaming a brighter
 color beneath the moonlight.
 “Is that —”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Unicorn's blood,” Hagrid said.
 The huge man's voice was sad.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a clearing ahead, visible through the tangled branches of a great oak,
 they saw the fallen creature, splayed beautiful and sad upon the ground,
 the dirt around her shining moon-silver with pooled blood.
 The unicorn was not white, but pale blue, or appearing so beneath the moon
 and night sky.
 Her slender legs stuck out at odd angles, obviously broken, and her mane
 spread across the dark leaves, green-black but with a sheen like pearls.
 On her flank was a small white shape like a starburst, a center surrounded
 by eight straight rays.
 Half her side had been ripped away, the edges ragged like the marks of
 teeth, bones and inner organs exposed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A strange choking sensation rose in Draco's throat.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“That's `er,” Hagrid said, his sad whisper as loud as a normal man's voice.
 “Just where I found `er this mornin', dead as a dead doorknob.
 She is — was — the first unicorn I e'er met in these woods.
 I called `er Alicorn, not that it matters ter `er any more, I s'pose.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“You named a unicorn Alicorn,” said the older girl.
 Her voice was a bit dry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“But she doesn't have wings,” Tracey said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“An alicorn's a unicorn's horn,” Hagrid said, now louder.
 “Don't know where yeh all started thinking it meant a unicorn with wings,
 `ere's no such thing I ever heard.
 It's just like naming a dog Fang,” indicating the huge wolf-like dog that
 barely came to his knees.
 “What'd you have called `er? Hannah, or some such? I gave `er a name as
 would've meant summat ter 
\emph on
'er.

\emph default
 Common courtesy, I call it.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nobody said anything to this, and after a further moment, the huge man gave
 a sharp nod.
 “We'll start our search from `ere, the last place it struck.
 We're gonna split inter two parties an' follow the trail in diff'rent direction
s.
 Yeh two, Walt and Yuliy — yeh'll go that way, and take Fang.
 There's nothin' that lives in the Forest that'll hurt yeh if yer with Fang.
 Send up green sparks if yeh find summat interestin', an' send up red sparks
 if anyone gets in trouble.
 Davis, Malfoy, with me.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Forest was black and silent.
 Rubeus Hagrid had dimmed the light of his umbrella after they'd set out,
 so that Draco and Tracey had to steer themselves by the light of the moon,
 not without occasional trips and falls.
 They walked past a mossy tree-stump, the sound of running water speaking
 of a stream somewhere close by.
 Now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of
 silver blue blood on the fallen leaves; they were following the trail of
 blood, toward where the creature must have first struck the unicorn.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“There's rumors about yeh,” Hagrid said in a low voice after they'd walked
 for a while.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Well, they're all true,” Tracey said.
 
\emph on
“All
\emph default
 of them.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Not yeh,” Hagrid said.
 “Did yeh really testify under Veritaserum that yeh tried to help Miss Granger,
 three times it was?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Draco weighed his words for a while, and finally said, “Yes.” It wouldn't
 have done to appear too eager to claim credit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The huge man shook his head, his great feet still stomping silently through
 the woods.
 “I'm surprised, teh be honest.
 And yeh too, Davis, tryin' to put the halls in order.
 Are yeh sure the Sorting Hat put yeh in the right place? There's not a
 single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin, so it's always
 been said.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“That's not true,” Tracey said.
 “What about Xiaonan Tong the Black Raven, Spencer of the Hill, and Mister
 Kayvon?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Who?” said Hagrid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Just some of the best Dark Wizards from the last two centuries,” Tracey
 said.
 “They're probably 
\emph on
the
\emph default
 best from Hogwarts who weren't from Slytherin.” Her voice fell, lost its
 enthusiasm.
 “Miss Granger always told me I should read up on anything I
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

—”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“
\emph on
Anyway
\emph default
,” Draco said quickly, “that's not really relevant, Mr.
 Hagrid.
 Even if
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

—” Draco worked it around in his head, trying to translate the difference
 between 
\emph on
probability of Slytherin given Dark
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
probability of Dark given Slytherin
\emph default
 into nonscientific language.
 “Even if most Dark Wizards are from Slytherin, very few Slytherins are
 Dark Wizards.
 There aren't all that many Dark Wizards, so not all Slytherins can be one.”
 Or as Father had said, while any Malfoy should certainly know much of the
 secret lore, the more… 
\emph on
costly
\emph default
 rituals were better left to useful fools like Amycus Carrow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“So yeh're saying,” Hagrid said, “that most Dark Wizards are Slytherins…
 but…”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“But most Slytherins are not Dark Wizards,” Draco said.
 He had a weary feeling they'd be at this a while, but like fighting a hydra,
 the important thing was to not give up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I never thought of it that way,” the huge man said, sounding awestruck.
 “But, well, if yeh're not all a house of snakes, then why — 
\emph on
get behind that tree!
\emph default
”

Hagrid seized Draco and Tracey and hoisted them off the path behind a towering
 oak.
 He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow, raising it, ready
 to fire.
 The three of them listened.
 Something was slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak
 trailing along the ground.
 Hagrid was squinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound
 faded away.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I knew it,” Hagrid murmured.
 “There's summat in here that shouldn' be.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They went after where the rustling sound had come from, with Hagrid in the
 lead and Tracey and Draco both gripping their wands at the ready, but they
 found nothing, despite searching in a widening circle with their ears straining
 for the faintest sound.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They walked on through the dense, dark trees.
 Draco kept looking over his shoulder, a feeling nagging at him that they
 were being watched.
 They had just passed a bend in the path when Tracey yelled and pointed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the distance, a shower of red sparks lit the air.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“You two wait here!” Hagrid shouted.
 “Stay where yeh are, I'll come back for yeh!”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before Draco could say a word, Hagrid spun and crashed away through the
 undergrowth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Draco and Tracey stood looking at each other, until they heard nothing but
 the rustling of leaves around them.
 Tracey looked scared, but trying to hide it.
 Draco was feeling more annoyed than anything else.
 One had the distinct impression that Rubeus Hagrid, when he had formed
 his plans for tonight, had not spent even five seconds visualizing the
 consequences if something actually went wrong.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Now what?” said Tracey, her voice a little high.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“We wait for Mr.
 Hagrid to come back.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The minutes dragged by.
 Draco's ears seemed sharper than usual, picking up every sigh of the wind,
 every cracking twig.
 Tracey kept looking up at the moon, as though to reassure herself that
 it wasn't full yet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I'm

 “I'm getting a little nervous, Mr.

\begin_layout Standard
Draco thought about it a bit.
 To be honest, there 
\emph on
was
\emph default
 something… well, it wasn't that he was a coward, or even that he was scared.
 But there had been a murder at Hogwarts and if he'd been watching himself
 in a play, having just been abandoned in the Forbidden Forest by a half-giant,
 he would currently feel like yelling at the boy on stage that he should…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Draco reached into his robes, and took out a mirror.
 Tapping the surface showed a man in red robes, who frowned almost immediately.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Auror Captain Eneasz Brodski,” the man said clearly, causing Tracey to
 start with the loudness in the quiet forest.
 “What is it, Draco Malfoy?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Put me on ten-minute check-in,” Draco said.
 He'd decided not to complain directly about his detention.
 He did

 want to look like a spoiled brat.
 “If I don't respond, come get me.
 I'm in the Forbidden Forest.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inside the mirror, the Auror's brows rose.
 “What are you doing in the Forbidden Forest, Mr.
 Malfoy?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Looking for the unicorn-eater with Mr.
 Hagrid,” Draco said, and tapped the mirror off, putting it back in his
 robes before the Auror could ask anything about detentions or say anything
 about serving it out without complaining.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tracey's head turned toward him, though it was a little too dim to read
 her expression.
 “Um, thanks,” she whispered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The few leaves which had emerged on their branches rustled as another, colder
 breeze blew through the forest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tracey's voice was a little louder when she spoke again.
 “You didn't have to

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Don't mention it, Miss Davis.”

The dark silhouette of Tracey put her hand to her cheek, as though to conceal
 a blush that wasn't visible anyway.
 “I mean, not for

\end_layout

“No, really,” Draco said.
 “Don't mention it.
 At all.” He would have threatened to take out the mirror and order Captain
 Brodski not to rescue 
\emph on
her,
\emph default
 but he was afraid she would consider that flirting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tracey's silhouetted head turned from him, looked away.
 Finally she said, in a smaller voice, “It's too soon, isn't it
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A high scream echoed through the woods, a not-quite-human sound, the scream
 of something like a horse; and Tracey shrieked and ran.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
“No, you nimrod!
\emph default
” yelled Draco, plunging after her.
 The sound had been so eerie that Draco wasn't absolutely certain where
 it came from — but he thought that Tracey Davis might, in fact, be running
 straight toward the source of that eerie scream.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Brambles whipped at Draco's eyes, he had to keep one hand in front of his
 face to shield them, trying not to lose track of Tracey because it seemed
 obvious that, if this was a play, and they got separated, 
\emph on
one
\emph default
 of them was going to die.
 Draco thought of the mirror secured within his robes but he somehow knew
 that if he tried to take it out one-handed while running, the mirror would
 inevitably fall and be lost

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ahead of them, Tracey had stopped, and Draco felt relieved for an instant,
 before he saw.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another unicorn lay on the ground, surrounded by a slowly widening pool
 of silver blood, the edge of the blood creeping across the ground like
 spilled mercury.
 Her coat was purple, like the color of the night sky, her horn exactly
 the same twilight color as her skin, her visible flank marked by a pink
 star-blotch surrounded by white patches.
 The sight tore at Draco's heart, even more than the other unicorn because
 this one's eyes were staring glassily right at him, and because there was
 a

it was looking at them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The blurring, seething, unrecognizable darkness seemed to turn to regard
 them.
 A hiss came from it, like the hiss of the deadliest snake which ever had
 existed, something more dangerous by far than any Blue Krait.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then it bent back over the wound in the unicorn, and continued to drink.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mirror was in Draco's hand, and it remained lifeless as his finger mechanica
lly tapped at the surface, over and over.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tracey was holding her wand now, saying things like “Prismatis” and “Stupefy”
 but nothing was happening.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then the seething outline rose up, like a man rising to his feet only not
 so; and it seemed to scuttle forward, moving with a strange half-jump across
 the dying unicorn's legs, approaching the two of them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tracey tugged at his sleeve and then turned to run, run from something that
 could hunt down unicorns.
 Before she could take three steps there came another terrible hiss, burning
 his ears, and Tracey fell to the ground and did not move.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Somewhere in the back of his mind, Draco knew that he was about to die.
 Even if the Auror checked his mirror this very instant, there was no way
 anyone could get here fast enough.
 There was no

 time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Running hadn't worked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Magic hadn't worked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The seething outline came closer, while Draco tried, in his last moments,
 to solve the riddle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then a blazing silver ball of light plunged out of the night sky and hung
 there, illuminating the forest as bright as daylight, and the seething
 outline leapt backwards, as though in horror of the light.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Four broomsticks plunged out of the sky, three Aurors with bright multicolored
 shields and Harry Potter holding his wand aloft, seated behind Professor
 McGonagall within a larger shield.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Get out of here!” roared Professor McGonagall

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

— an instant before the seething thing gave forth another terrible hiss,
 and all the shielding spells winked out.
 The three Aurors and Professor McGonagall fell off their broomsticks and
 dropped heavily to the forest floor, lying motionless.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Draco couldn't breathe, the most intense fear he'd ever felt in his life
 gripping all through his chest, sending tendrils around his heart.
\end_layout

Harry Potter, who had remained untouched, silently guided his broomstick
 toward the ground

\end_layout

“Run!” said Harry Potter, turning his head half-back to look at Draco.
 The silver moonlight gleamed on his face.
 “Run, Draco! I'll hold it off!”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
“You can't fight that thing alone!” Draco cried aloud.
 A nausea was in his stomach, a churning sensation that, looking back in
 memory, seemed both like and unlike a sense of guilt, as though it had
 the sensations but not quite all of the emotion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
“I must,” Harry Potter said grimly.
 “Go!”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

“Harry, I — I'm sorry, for everything — I” Though later, looking back, Draco

 that he was planning to overthrow Harry's conspiracy, all that time ago.

 crying something that Draco couldn't make out from the distance; Draco

 into something, hitting his head

\begin_layout Standard
Harry held a tight grip on his wand, a Prismatic Sphere glowing around him.
 He stared levelly at the seething, blurring form in front of him, and said,
 “What on Earth are you doing?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The seething blurs resolved, reformed, relaxed back into a hooded form.
 Whatever concealment had been at work — a device rather than a Charm, Harry
 guessed, since the magic had been able to affect him — had prevented his
 mind from recognizing the shape or even that the shape was human.
 But it hadn't prevented Harry from recognizing the sharp sense of doom.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor Quirrell stood straight with silver blood all down the front of
 his enshrouding black cloak, and gave a sigh, looking at the fallen forms
 of three Aurors, Tracey Davis, Draco Malfoy, and Professor McGonagall.
 “I had honestly thought,” Professor Quirrell murmured, “that I jammed that
 mirror without alarm.
 What were two first-year Slytherins doing alone in the Forbidden Forest?
 Mr.
 Malfoy has more sense than this… What a fiasco.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry didn't answer.
 The sense of doom was as strong as Harry could ever remember feeling it,
 a feeling of power in the air so great that it was almost tangible.
 Some part of him was still viscerally shocked at how fast the shields surroundi
ng the Aurors had been torn apart.
 He almost hadn't been able to 
\emph on
see
\emph default
 the successive lashes of color which had torn away the shields like tissue
 paper.
 It made the duel Professor Quirrell had fought against the Auror in Azkaban
 look like a mockery, a child's game — though Professor Quirrell had claimed,
 then, that if he'd fought for real the Auror would have been dead in seconds;
 and Harry knew now that this was also true.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Just how high did the power ladder go?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I take it,” Harry said, managing to keep his voice steady, “that your eating
 unicorns has something to do with why you'll get fired from the Defense
 Professor position.
 I don't suppose you'd care to explain in considerable detail?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor Quirrell looked at him.
 The almost tangible sense of power in the air seemed to diminish, drawing
 back into the Defense Professor.
 “I shall indeed explain myself,” the Defense Professor said.
 “I need to cast a few Memory Charms first, and then we may go off and discuss
 it, for it would not be wise for me to stay.
 You will return to this time later, as I know.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry willed himself to be able to see through the Cloak he had mastered;
 and knew that another Harry stood beside him, hidden by his own Deathly
 Hallow.
 Harry then told his Cloak to hide himself from himself once more, and it
 did; being able to perceive your future self meant having to match the
 memory later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry's own voice said, then, sounding strange in present-Harry's ears,
 “He has a surprisingly good explanation.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Present-Harry remembered the words as best he could.
 Nothing more was said between them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor Quirrell walked to Draco's form, and chanted the spell of the
 False Memory Charm.
 The Defense Professor stood there for perhaps a minute, seemingly lost
 to the world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry had been studying Memory Charms, these last couple of weeks — though
 he couldn't have helped cast the spells, unless he was willing to exhaust
 himself almost completely, and for some reason they wanted an Auror to
 lose every single life memory involving the color blue.
 But Harry had some idea, now, of the concentration which the far more difficult
 False Memory Charm entailed.
 You had to try to live the other person's entire life inside your own head,
 at least if you wanted to create the False Memories with less than a sixteen-to
-one slowdown as you separately crafted sixteen major tracks of memory.
 It might have been quiet, there might have been no outward sign; but Harry
 knew something of the difficulties now, and he knew to be impressed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor Quirrell finished, and moved on to Tracey Davis, then the three
 Aurors, and finally Professor McGonagall.
 Harry waited, but future-Harry made no protest.
 It was possible that even Professor McGonagall, if she'd been awake, wouldn't
 have protested.
 It was not yet the Ides of May, and apparently there would be a surprisingly
 good explanation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With a gesture, Draco's stunned body was lifted, and sent a short distance
 into the woods, before being carefully deposited on the ground.
 Then a final gesture from Professor Quirrell ripped a huge chunk out of
 the unicorn's side, leaving behind ragged edges; the raw meat hovered in
 the air, then wavered in Vanishment and was gone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Done,” Professor Quirrell said.
 “I must depart this place now, Mr.
 Potter.
 Come with me, and remain here.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor Quirrell strode away, and Harry followed and remained behind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They walked through the woods in silence for a time, before Harry heard
 faint voices in the distance.
 The next set of Aurors, presumably, after the first set had fallen out
 of contact.
 What his future self was saying, Harry didn't know.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“They won't detect us, nor hear our speech,” said Professor Quirrell.
 The sense of power and doom around the Defense Professor was still strong.
 The man seated himself on a tree stump, one where the light of the almost-full
 moon fell full on him.
 “I should first say that when you speak to the Aurors, in the future, you
 should tell them that you frightened away the seething dark, the same as
 you did that Dementor.
 It is what Mr.
 Malfoy will remember seeing.” Professor Quirrell gave a small sigh.
 “It may cause some alarm, if they conclude that some horror kin to Dementors,
 and strong enough to break the Aurors' shields, is loose in the Forbidden
 Forest.
 But I could not think of what else to do.
 If the forest is better-guarded after this — but with any luck I have already
 consumed what I need.
 Would you mind telling me how you arrived so quickly? How did you know
 Mr.
 Malfoy was in trouble?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After Captain Brodski had learned that Draco Malfoy was in the Forbidden
 Forest, seemingly in the company of Rubeus Hagrid, Brodski had begun inquiring
 to find out who had authorized this, and had still been unable to find
 out when Draco Malfoy had missed check-in.
 Despite Harry's protests, the Auror Captain, who was authorized to know
 about Time-Turners, had refused to allow deployment to before the time
 of the missed check-in; there were standard procedures involving Time.
 But Brodski had given Harry written orders allowing him to go back and
 deploy an Auror trio to arrive one second after the missed check-in time.
 There had been a Patronus Charm to locate Draco, which Harry had successfully
 willed to take the form of a ball of pure silver light, and the flight
 of Aurors had arrived on time to the second.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I'm afraid I couldn't say,” Harry replied evenly.
 Professor Quirrell was still a major suspect, and it was good for him not
 to know the details.
 “Now why are you eating unicorns?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Ah,” Professor Quirrell said.
 “As to that…” The man hesitated.
 “I was drinking the blood of unicorns, not eating them.
 The missing flesh, the ragged marks upon the body — those were to obscure
 the case, to make it seem like some other predator.
 The use of unicorn's blood is too well-known.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I don't know it,” Harry said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I know you do not,” the Defense Professor said sharply.
 “Or you would not be pestering me about it.
 The power of unicorn's blood is to preserve your life for a time, even
 if you are on the very verge of death.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a stretch of time when Harry's brain claimed to be refusing to
 process the words, which was of course a lie, because you couldn't know
 the meaning you weren't allowed to process, without having already processed
 it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A strange sense of blankness overtook Harry, an absence of reaction, maybe
 this was what other people felt like when someone went off-script, and
 they couldn't say or think of anything to do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course Professor Quirrell was dying, not just occasionally ill.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor Quirrell had known he was dying.
 He'd volunteered to take the Defense Professor position at Hogwarts, after
 all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course he'd been getting worse the whole school year.
 Of course illnesses which kept getting worse had a predictable destination
 at their end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry's brain had surely known already, somewhere in the safe back of his
 mind where he could refuse to process things he'd already processed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course that was why Professor Quirrell wouldn't be able to teach Battle
 Magic next year.
 Professor McGonagall wouldn't even have to fire him.
 He would just be —
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
— dead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“No,” Harry said, his voice a little shaky.
 “There has to be a way —”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I am not stupid nor particularly eager to die.
 I have already looked.
 I had to go this far simply to last out my lesson plans, having less time
 than I had thought, and —” The head of the dark moonlit figure turned away.
 “I think I do not want to hear about it, Mr.
 Potter.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry's breath hitched.
 Too many emotions were bubbling up in him at once.
 After denial came anger, according to a ritual someone had just made up.
 And yet it seemed surprisingly appropriate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“And why —” Harry's breath hitched again.
 “Why isn't unicorn's blood standard in healer's kits, then? To keep someone
 alive, even if they're on the very verge of dying from their legs being
 eaten?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Because there are permanent side effects,” Professor Quirrell said quietly.

“Side effects?

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Not everyone thinks the same way we do, Mr.
 Potter.
 Though, to be fair, the blood must come from a live unicorn and the unicorn
 must die in the drinking.
 Would I be here otherwise?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry turned, stared at the surrounding trees.
 “Have a herd of unicorns at St.
 Mungos.
 Floo the patients there, or use portkeys.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Yes, that would work.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry's face tightened, the only outward sign behind his trembling hands
 of everything that was welling up inside him.
 He needed to scream, needed some outlet, needed

something
\emph default
 he couldn't name and finally Harry leveled his wand at a tree and shouted
 
\emph on
“Diffindo!

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a sharp tearing sound, and a cut appeared across the wood.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
“Diffindo!”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another cut.
 Harry had learned the Charm only ten days previously, after he'd started
 getting serious about self-defense.
 It was theoretically a second-year Charm, but the anger pouring through
 him seemed to know no bounds, he knew enough now not to exhaust himself
 and he still had power yet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
“Diffindo!

” Harry had aimed at a branch this time, and it plummeted to the ground
 with a sound of twigs and leaves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There didn't seem to be any tears inside him, only pressure with no outlet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I shall leave you to it,” Professor Quirrell said quietly.
 The Defense Professor rose from his tree stump, the unicorn's blood still
 moonlit on the black cloak he wore, and drew his hood back over his head.
