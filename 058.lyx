, un ragazzo era in piedi reggendo la propria bacchetta contro il muro di
 solido metallo di Azkaban, cimentandosi in una magia che solo altre tre
 persone al mondo avrebbero creduto possibile, e che nessuno eccetto lui
 poteva brandire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ovviamente un mago potente avrebbe potuto tagliare attraverso il muro in
 pochi secondi, con un gesto e una parola.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Per un adulto medio sarebbe potuto essere un lavoro di pochi minuti, e in
 seguito sarebbe stato ansimante.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ma per ottenere lo stesso fine come studente del primo anno di Hogwarts,
 saresti dovuto essere 
\emph on
efficiente
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fortunatamente -- beh, non 
\emph on
fortunatamente
\emph default
, la fortuna non aveva nulla a che fare con quello -- 
\emph on
coscienziosamente
\emph default
, Harry si era allenato con la Trasfigurazione per un'ora in più ogni giorno,
 fino al punto di essere persino davanti a Hermione in quell'unico corso;
 aveva fatto pratica con la Trasfigurazione parziale fino al punto che i
 suoi pensieri avevano iniziato a dare per scontato il vero universo, cosicché
 fosse necessario solo un piccolo sforzo ulteriore per tenerne a mente la
 sua struttura quantistica senza tempo, anche mentre manteneva una solida
 separazione mentale tra il concetto di Forma e il concetto di sostanza.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
E il 
\emph on
problema
\emph default
 col fatto che quell'arte era diventata così consuetudinaria…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
… era che Harry poteva pensare ad altre cose mentre la stava praticando.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In qualche modo i suoi pensieri erano riusciti a non andare lì, a non confrontar
si con l'evidente, finché non dovette fronteggiare la prospettiva di 
\emph on
farlo davvero, effettivamente, in appena pochi minuti
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ciò che Harry stava per fare…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
… era pericoloso.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Davvero pericoloso.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
`Qualcuno potrebbe effettivamente autenticamente finire ucciso' pericoloso.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fronteggiare dodici Dissennatori senza un Incantesimo Patronus era stato
 
\emph on
spaventoso
\emph default
, ma puramente spaventoso.
 Harry avrebbe potuto lanciare l'Incantesimo Patronus, 
\emph on
l'avrebbe
\emph default
 lanciato non appena avesse pensato di correre il pericolo di non essere
 in grado di farlo, non appena avesse sentito iniziare a cedere la propria
 resistenza.
 E anche se non avesse funzionato… anche così, a meno che i Dissennatori
 non avessero ricevuto l'ordine di Baciare chiunque avessero trovato, il
 fallimento non sarebbe stato 
\emph on
fatale
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Questo era differente.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Il dispositivo babbano Trasfigurato poteva esplodere e ucciderli.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
L'interfaccia tra la tecnologia e la magia avrebbe potuto venir meno in
 un gran numero di modi e ucciderli.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gli Auror potevano ottenere un colpo fortunato.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Era semplicemente, beh…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Seriamente
\emph default
 pericoloso.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry aveva pizzicato la sua mente mentre cercava di convincere sé stessa
 che fosse sicuro.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
E certo, l'intera faccenda 
\emph on
poteva
\emph default
 funzionare, ma…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ma anche lasciando da parte il fatto che i razionalisti non erano autorizzati
 a convincere sé stessi di qualcosa, Harry sapeva che non c'era modo di
 convincersi a stimare in meno del 20% la probabilità di morire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Perdi,
\emph default
 disse Tassofrasso.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Perdi
\emph default
, disse la voce del professor Quirrell nella sua mente.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Perdi
\emph default
, disse il suo modello mentale di Hermione e della professoressa McGonagall
 e del professor Flitwick e di Neville Longbottom e di, beh, fondamentalmente
 tutti coloro che Harry conosceva con l'eccezione di Fred e George, che
 ci si sarebbero buttati in un secondo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Avrebbe dovuto semplicemente andare a trovare Silente e consegnarsi.
 Avrebbe dovuto farlo, avrebbe dovuto davvero farlo, era l'unica cosa 
\emph on
sana di mente
\emph default
 da fare a quel punto.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
E se fosse stato solo Harry in missione, se fosse stata solo la sua vita
 in gioco, l'avrebbe fatto; l'avrebbe fatto certamente.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
La parte che gli stava quasi facendo perdere la sua concentrazione sulla
 Trasfigurazione parziale che stava effettuando, la parte che stava minacciando
 di aprirlo ai Dissennatori…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
… era il professor Quirrell, ancora senza sensi, ancora un serpente.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Se il professor Quirrell fosse andato ad Azkaban a causa della sua parte
 nella fuga, sarebbe morto.
 Non sarebbe probabilmente resistito una settimana.
 Era così sensibile.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Era così semplice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Se Harry avesse 
\emph on
perduto
\emph default
 qui…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Avrebbe perso il professor Quirrell.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Anche se probabilmente è malvagio
\emph default
, disse pacatamente la parte Tassofrasso di sé stesso.
 
\emph on
Anche così?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Non era una decisione che Harry avesse preso in modo conscio.
 Semplicemente non poteva farlo.
 Si potevano perdere punti-Casa, non 
\emph on
persone
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Se pensi che la tua stessa vita sia tanto preziosa che non sei disposto
 ad accettare una probabilità dell'ottanta percento di morire allo scopo
 di proteggere tutti i prigionieri in Azkaban
\emph default
, osservò il suo lato Serpeverde,
\emph on
 non c'è modo che tu possa giustificare l'assumerti un venti percento di
 rischio per la tua vita per salvare Bellatrix e il professor Quirrell.
 I conti non tornano, non puoi assegnare utilità coerenti a questi risultati.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Il suo lato logico notò che Serpeverde aveva appena vinto la discussione.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry mantenne in mente la Forma, continuò a lanciare l'incantesimo.
 Avrebbe sempre potuto interrompere semplicemente la missione quando avesse
 
\emph on
finito
\emph default
 con la Trasfigurazione, non voleva perdere lo sforzo che ci aveva già investito.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
E poi Harry pensò a qualcos'altro che rese improvvisamente molto difficile
 continuare a far fluire la magia, molto difficile mantenere in piedi la
 sua resistenza ai Dissennatori.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
E se il passaporta non ci portasse dove il professor Quirrell ha detto che
 ci avrebbe portato?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Era ovvio a posteriori nel momento in cui ci pensò.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anche se il piano di fuga fosse andato completamente nel verso giusto, anche
 se il dispositivo babbano avesse funzionato e 
\emph on
non fosse
\emph default
 esploso e 
\emph on
non avesse
\emph default
 interagito male con l'oggetto magico accoppiato, anche se gli Auror non
 avessero avuto un tiro fortunato, anche se Harry fosse riuscito ad allontanarsi
 da Azkaban abbastanza da poter usare il passaporta…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
… poteva non esserci un guaritore psichiatrico dall'altra parte.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Quello era qualcosa a cui Harry aveva creduto quando si fidava del professor
 Quirrell, e aveva dimenticato di valutare di nuovo dopo che il professor
 Quirrell non era più qualcuno di cui fidarsi.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Non puoi farlo
\emph default
, disse Tassofrasso.
 
\emph on
A questo punto stiamo parlando di idiozia.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Il freddo sembrò diffondersi attraverso la stanza, ma Harry continuò a mantenere
 la Trasfigurazione, anche mentre la sua resistenza contro i Dissennatori
 vacillava.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Non posso perdere il professor Quirrell.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Ha cercato di uccidere un agenti di polizia
\emph default
, disse Tassofrasso.
 
\emph on
L'hai già perso, in quel momento.
 Bellatrix probabilmente è ciò che tutti pensano che sia.
 Riprenditi semplicemente il tuo Mantello, vai a cercare Silente e digli
 che sei stato ingannato.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
No
\emph default
, pensò disperatamente Harry, 
\emph on
non senza parlare al professor Quirrell, potrebbe esserci una spiegazione,
 non so, forse era abbastanza lontano dal mio Patronus che i Dissennatori
 l'hanno raggiunto… non capisco, non ha senso sotto nessuna ipotesi, perché
 avrebbe dovuto farlo… non riesco…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry distolse la mente dalla catena di pensieri prima che distruggesse
 completamente la sua resistenza alla paura, perché non poteva pensare di
 dare il professor Quirrell in pasto ai Dissennatori e rimanere risoluto
 contro la Morte, era un'impossibilità cognitiva.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
La tua capacità di ragionare è compromessa artificialmente
\emph default
, osservò con calma la sua parte razionale, 
\emph on
trova un modo di ripristinarla
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Va bene, iniziamo semplicemente a generare alternative
\emph default
, pensò Harry.
 
\emph on
Non scegliere, non soppesare, certamente non impegnarmi… semplicemente pensare
 a cos'altro potrei essere in grado di fare a parte il piano originale.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
E Harry continuò a praticare un foro nel muro.
 Stava usando una Trasfigurazione parziale su di un sottile guscio cilindrico
 di metallo, due metri di diametro e mezzo millimetro di spessore, che attravers
ava completamente il muro.
 Stava Trasfigurando quello spessore di mezzo millimetro di metallo in olio
 per motori.
 L'olio per motori era liquido e non avresti dovuto Trasfigurare liquidi
 perché sarebbero potuti evaporare, ma egli e Bellatrix e il serpente aveva
 tutti Incantesimi Testa-Bolla.
 E Harry avrebbe lanciato un Finite sull'olio immediatamente dopo, disperdendo
 la propria Trasfigurazione…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
… non appena il grosso pezzo di metallo disgiunto e lubrificato fosse scivolato
 fuori dal muro e sul pavimento della loro cella, l'aveva inclinato in modo
 che la gravità l'avrebbe tirato dentro, una volta che al Trasfigurazione
 fosse terminata.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If Harry and Bellatrix 
\emph on
didn't
\emph default
 exit on his broomstick through the resulting hole in the wall…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry's brain suggested that he could try to Transfigure a surface cover
 over the hole in the wall, leaving a space for Bellatrix and Professor
 Quirrell to hide in, wearing the Cloak, while Harry turned himself in.
 And Professor Quirrell would eventually wake up, and he and Bellatrix could
 try to figure out how to exit Azkaban on their own.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was, first of all, a dumb idea, and second, there would still be a huge
 hunk of metal on the floor of the cell, which would give it away.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then Harry's brain saw the obvious.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Let Bellatrix and Professor Quirrell use the escape route you invented.
 You stay behind, and turn yourself in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bellatrix and Professor Quirrell were the ones whose lives were at stake.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They were gaining, not losing, from taking the risk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And there was no reason, no sane reason at all, for Harry to go with them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A calm came over Harry as he thought it, the cold and darkness that had
 been wavering around the fringes of his mind retreated.
 Yes, that was it, that was the creative outside-the-box route, that was
 the hidden third alternative.
 The falseness of the dilemma was obvious in retrospect.
 If Harry turned himself in, he 
\emph on
didn't
\emph default
 have to turn in Bellatrix and Professor Quirrell.
 If Bellatrix and Professor Quirrell took a dangerous escape route, Harry
 
\emph on
didn't
\emph default
 need to go with them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry didn't even need to face the embarrassment of admitting he'd been
 tricked, if he ordered Bellatrix to remove the memory.
 Everyone would just assume he'd been kidnapped, including Harry himself.
 Admittedly, there was no plausible reason why the Dark Lord would ever
 ask Bellatrix to do that; but Harry could simply smile and tell Bellatrix
 she wasn't allowed to know, and that would be that…

\begin_layout Standard
Her Auror team had gotten around three-quarters of the way down Azkaban,
 as had the other two teams on the other two spirals.
 Amelia was feeling tenser already, though she was betting on the criminals
 hiding on the second-to-lowest floor, part of her wished Dumbledore had
 thought to check that specific floor more carefully and part of her was
 glad he hadn't.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then there was a distant sound, like a tiny `tink' noise coming from
 far away.
 Like a very loud sound coming from the second-to-lowest floor, say.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amelia looked at Dumbledore before she realized, before she managed to stop
 herself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The old wizard shrugged, gave her a small smile, said, “Since you asked

“

\emph default
 Harry said to the oil coating the giant chunk of metal on the floor.
 He hardly heard himself speak, his ears were still ringing from the gigantic
 thud of the solid metal sliding out of the wall and falling.
 (He should have put up a Quieting Charm, in retrospect, though that wouldn't
 have stopped the noise from spreading through the solid metal floor.) And
 then Harry said it again, “
\emph on

\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to the oil coating the two-meter hole in the wall, spreading the effect
 wide; it was his own magic Harry was canceling, which made the spell almost
 effortless.
 Harry was feeling a bit tired now, but that was the last use of magic he
 would need.
 He hadn't even 
\emph on
needed
\emph default
 to do it, really, but Harry didn't want to leave Transfigured liquid lying
 around, and he didn't want to betray the secret of partial Transfiguration
 either.
\end_layout

It seemed very…

Harry

was

 tempted to just go with, just hop on the broomstick with Bellatrix and
 the snake.
 Chances were that they 
\emph on
would
\emph default
 get out safely.
 And if they 
\emph on
did
\emph default
 get out safely, and Harry came with, then he and Professor Quirrell could
 go back in time and look perfectly innocent, everything could go back to
 normal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If Harry stayed behind and turned himself in… then even if everyone assumed
 Harry had been a hostage, assumed Harry had lied to Professor McGonagall's
 Patronus at wandpoint… even if Harry himself got off lightly, well…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It wasn't likely that the Defense Professor would go on teaching at Hogwarts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor Quirrell would have reached the predestined end of his career,
 in February of the school year.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And yes, Professor McGonagall would kill Harry, and yes, it would be slow
 and painful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But staying behind was the sensible, safe, 
\emph on
sane
\emph default
 thing to do, and Harry was feeling more relaxed than regretful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry turned to Bellatrix; he opened his mouth to instruct her a final time

And Harry took the broomstick and presented it to Bellatrix, saying simply,
 “Get on.”

He had decided to keep the memories.
 For one thing, they were important.
 For another, he and the Defense Professor had started planning this a week

 and though the Defense Professor was pale, leaning against the metal bars
 of the nearest cell, his magic was strong enough to seize his wand without
 a word, even as Bellatrix doffed the Cloak and placed it obediently in
 Harry's waiting hand.
 The sense of doom was building once more, though not in full force, as
 the Defense Professor's power returned, the fringes of its vast force clashing

Harry said aloud the description of his Muggle device, naming it to the

 Professor Quirrell could not cast spells on something Harry had Transfigured,
 for that would be an interaction, however slight, between their magics,
 but

Three seconds after, Professor Quirrell was holding his own Transfigured
 version of the Muggle device.
 A single barked word and a sweep of his wand, and the residue of glue was
 gone from the magical item; three more incantations later, the magical
 and technological were fused together as though into a single thing, and
 Charms of Unbreakability and flawless function had been cast upon the Muggle
 device.

\begin_layout Standard
A potion was thrown to Bellatrix, and Professor Quirrell and Harry both
 commanded, “Drink,” as though speaking in the same voice.
 The emaciated woman had already been lifting it to her lips, without waiting;
 for it was evident to anyone that this snake Animagus was a servant of
 the Dark Lord, and a powerful and trusted one.

Harry finished pulling the hood of the Cloak of Invisibility over his head.

A brief and terrible magic lashed out from the Defense Professor's wand,
 scouring the hole in the wall, scarring the huge chunk of metal that lay
 in the room's midst; as Harry had requested, saying that the method he'd
 used might identify him.

“Left-hand glove,” Harry said to his pouch, and drew it forth, and put it
 on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A gesture from the Defense Professor made a harness appear upon Bellatrix's
 shoulders, and another, smaller cloth device upon her hand, and something
 like handcuffs on her wrists, even as the woman finished drinking the potion.

\begin_layout Standard
A strange, unhealthy color seemed to come over Bellatrix's pale face, she
 straightened, her sunken eyes seemed brighter and far more dangerous…

…small wisps of steam were coming out of her ears…

(Very soon, the Defense Professor had said, Bellatrix would fall unconscious
 and stay that way for quite awhile, the price of the potion she had taken;
 but for just a few moments she would regain perhaps a twentieth part of
 the power she had once wielded.)

Harry angled the broomstick and began accelerating, upward and toward the

 His left hand, gloved to prevent direct contact between his skin and something

From the decaying pit in the center of Azkaban, over a hundred Dementors

 graveyard; appearing to another as a conglomerate of absences that seemed
 to form one vast rip in the world as they slid upward.

The voice of an ancient and powerful wizard bellowed a terrible incantation,
