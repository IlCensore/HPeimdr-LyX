Una brillante creatura rosso-dorata entrò strascicando nel campo visivo,
 poi guardò giù interrogativamente; e iniziò a canticchiare.

The meaningless chirps slid off the emptiness, there was nothing onto which
 they could hold.

Then a shining raven came, and spoke in Professor Flitwick's voice; whereupon
 Albus Dumbledore gasped in sudden comprehension, and cursed aloud at his
 own stupidity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The empty thing laughed at that, for it had retained the capacity to be
 amused.
\end_layout

And a moment later they had all vanished in another flash of fire.

It was only a moment, it seemed, between when Flitwick's raven had flown
 to elsewhere, and when Albus Dumbledore reappeared in another crack of
 red and golden fire with Harry in his arms; but somehow in that time Hermione
 had already managed to fill her hands with chocolate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before Hermione even got there, chocolate had zoomed off the table and straight
 into Harry's mouth, which a tiny part of her mind said was unfair,

Harry spat the chocolate back out again.

\begin_layout Standard
“Go away,” said a voice so empty it wasn't even cold.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Everything seemed to freeze, everyone who had been moving toward Harry halted,
 all movements broken by the shock of those two dead words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then: “No,” said Albus Dumbledore, “I will not,” and time resumed again,
 even as another piece of chocolate zoomed off the table and into Harry's
 mouth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hermione was close enough now that she could see Harry's expression become
 more hateful, as his mouth chewed with a mechanical, unnatural rhythm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Headmaster's voice was grim as iron.
 “Filius, call Minerva, tell her she must come at speed.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor Flitwick whispered to his silver raven, and it flew into the air
 and vanished.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another piece of chocolate floated into Harry's mouth, and the mechanical
 chewing continued.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There were more students gathering around where the Headmaster watched over
 Harry with grim eyes: Neville, Seamus, Dean, Lavender, Ernie, Terry, Anthony,
 none of them daring to approach any closer than Hermione had.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“What can we do?” said Dean in a trembling voice.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“No!” interrupted the Headmaster.
 “Let him be surrounded by his friends.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry swallowed his chocolate, and said in that empty voice, “They're stupid.
 They should die

Hermione saw the looks of shock that crossed their faces.

“He doesn't mean it, does he?” Seamus said it like he was begging.

“You don't understand,” Hermione said, her voice breaking, “

had

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She saw from the look on his face that Neville understood, and she also
 saw that the others didn't.
 If Harry had really never thought anything like that, then being exposed
 to a Dementor for less than a minute wouldn't have made him say it.
 That's what they were probably thinking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Less than a minute of Dementor exposure couldn't create a whole new evil
 person inside you out of nothing.

Something about the tenor of that thought made Hermione nervous.

What sort of plan?

It is better that you not know,

Then her eyes moved, breaking gaze with the Headmaster, going to the boy
 looking around with empty, despising eyes as his mouth kept chewing and
 swallowing bar after bar of chocolate without effect.
 Her heart wrenched, and suddenly a lot of things didn't seem to matter,
 only that there was a chance.

There was a compulsion to chew and swallow chocolate.
 The response to compulsion was killing.

People had gathered around and stared.
 That was annoying.
 The response to annoyance was killing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other people were chattering in the background.
 That was insolent.
 The response to insolence was to inflict pain, but since none of them were
 useful, killing them would be simpler.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Killing all those people would be difficult.
 But many of them didn't trust Quirrell, who was strong.
 Finding exactly the right trigger could cause them all to kill each other.

Then a person leaned over into the field of vision and did something completely
 strange, something that belonged to a foreign mode of thought, for which
