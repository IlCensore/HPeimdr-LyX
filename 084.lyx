 svegliò, si trovò distesa in un letto morbido e confortevole dell'infermeria
 di Hogwarts, con un quadrato di luce solare al tramonto che cadeva sul
 suo ombelico, abbastanza caldo attraverso la sottile coltre.
 La memoria le diceva che ci sarebbe dovuta essere una tendina schermante
 sopra di lei, o tirata intorno al suo letto o aperta, e che il resto del
 dominio di Madama Pomfrey sarebbe stato al di là: gli altri letti, occupati
 o non occupati, e le luminose finestre impostate nel sinuosa pietra scolpita
 di Hogwarts.

\begin_layout Standard
Quando Hermione aprì gli occhi, la prima cosa che vide fu il volto della
 professoressa McGonagall, seduta sul lato sinistro del suo letto.
 Il professor Flitwick non era presente, ma ciò era comprensibile, era rimasto
 al suo fianco per tutta la mattina nella cella di detenzione, il suo corvo
 d'argento di ulteriore guardia contro il Dissennatore e il suo piccolo
 viso severo rivolto sempre verso l'esterno in direzione degli Auror.
 Il Preside di Corvonero aveva sicuramente passato troppo tempo con di lei,
 e probabilmente era dovuto tornare a tenere le sue lezioni, invece di vegliare
 su una tentata-assassina condannata.

\begin_layout Standard
Si sentiva terribilmente, terribilmente malata e non pensava che fosse a
 causa di qualche pozione.
 Hermione avrebbe iniziato a piangere di nuovo, solo che la gola le faceva
 male, gli occhi ancora bruciavano, e la sua mente si sentiva stanca.
 Non avrebbe sopportato di piangere ancora, non riusciva a trovare la forza
 per le lacrime.

La gentile espressione del volto della professoressa McGonagall si Trasfigurò

Mi dispiace, signorina Granger.
 Sebbene non sia sempre stato così, abbiamo scoperto negli ultimi anni che

No, signorina Granger.
 Il signor Potter crede che lei sia stata sottoposta a Incantesimo di Memoria,

 Il Preside sospetta possano essere state in gioco magie persino più Oscure

 sua volontà.
 Anche il professor Snape ritiene la faccenda completamente incredibile,
 anche se non può essere in grado di dirlo pubblicamente.

 La sua eccellente memoria ripeté servizievolmente la scena per la millesima

 quando non fosse stato stanco, e poi aveva proceduto a dimostrarlo, danzando
 come un duellista tra i trofei protetti mentre ella si era freneticamente
 mossa goffamente, e alla fine le aveva dato il colpo mortale con una fattura

Si era svegliata e aveva ricordato quello che era successo la notte precedente,
 ed era stato come -- come se -- non riusciva a trovare le parole neppure
 nei propri pensieri per definire quella sensazione.
 Ma aveva saputo che Draco Malfoy era già morto, e non aveva detto nulla,
 non era andata a confessarlo dal professor Flitwick.
 Semplicemente si era vestita ed era scesa a colazione e aveva

Fu allora che Hermione seppe che la professoressa McGonagall non poteva

 Aveva bisogno di qualcuno che la rimproverasse, non poteva essere assolta

Ci fu una pausa.
 I rumori lontani dell'infermeria che avevano accompagnato la professoressa

 Most ill-doers do not think of themselves as evil; indeed, most conceive

 I once thought that the greatest evil in this world was done in the name

 I was wrong.
 Terribly wrong.

 All fair things does it desire to destroy.”

 “You are one of the fair things of this world, Hermione Granger, and so
 that evil hates you as well.
 If you had stayed firm through even this trial, it would have struck you

 Do not think that heroes cannot be broken! We are only more difficult to
 break, Hermione.” The old wizard's eyes had grown sterner than she had ever
 seen.
 “When you have been exhausted for many hours, when pain and death is not
 a passing fear but a certainty, then it is harder to be a hero.
 If I must speak the truth

 “For thrice ten years I wondered, and I still do not understand.

Hermione let her head fall back to the bed, as Madam Pomfrey came and made

 It meant nothing to her.

 I do not think Voldemort can essay such possessions often, or against stronger

 “I fear the boy has spent too much time among the Muggles.

“Not everyone seems to think so,” said Professor McGonagall.
 It had been almost the first letter she'd seen when she'd taken a quick

 “I have received Lord Malfoy's owl withdrawing his son from Hogwarts.”

\begin_layout Standard
The holding cell, well to the center of Magical Law Enforcement, was luxuriously
 appointed; more a remark on what adult wizards took for granted, than any
 special feeling toward prisoners.
 There was a self-reclining, self-rocking chair with plush, richly textured,
 self-warming cushions.
 There was a bookcase containing random books rescued from a bargain bin,
 and a full shelf of ancient magazines, including one from 1883.
 As for toiletries, well, it wasn't exactly luxurious, but there was a spell
 on the room which put all that business on hold; you weren't to go anywhere
 that the watching Auror couldn't see you.
 But aside from that, it was quite a pleasant little cell.
 The Defense Professor of Hogwarts was being detained, not arrested, not
 even intimidated.
 There was no evidence to indict him… except that a terrible and unusual
 crime had been committed at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,
 and going by previous occasions the odds were five to one that the current
 Defense Professor was tangled up in it 
\emph on
somehow
\emph default
.
 To this must be added the fact that nobody in the D.M.L.E.
 even knew who the Defense Professor 
\emph on
was
\emph default
, and that the man had literally 
\emph on
sneezed
\emph default
 at all attempts to uncover his true identity.
 Why, no, they 
\emph on
hadn't
\emph default
 released `Quirinus Quirrell' back to Hogwarts just yet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us repeat this for emphasis:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Defense Professor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Was being detained.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a cell.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Defense Professor was staring at the watching Auror and humming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Defense Professor has not spoken a single word since he arrived in this
 particular cell.
 He has 
\emph on
only
\emph default
 been humming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The humming started as a simple children's lullaby, the one that in Muggle
 Britain begins, 
\emph on
Lullaby, and goodnight…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tune was hummed, without variation, over and over, for seven minutes,
 to establish the underlying pattern.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then began the elaborations upon the theme.
 Phrases hummed too slow, with long pauses in between, so that the listener's
 mind helplessly waits and waits for the next note, the next phrase.
 And then, when that next phrase comes, it is so out of key, so unbelievably
 awfully out of key, not just out of key for the previous phrases but sung
 at a pitch which does not correspond to
\emph on
 any
\emph default
 key, that you would have to believe this person had spent hours deliberately
 practicing their humming just to acquire such perfect anti-pitch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It bears the same semblance to music as the awful dead voice of a Dementor
 bears to human speech.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And this horrible, horrible humming is 
\emph on
impossible
\emph default
 to ignore.
 It is similar to a known lullaby, but it departs from that pattern unpredictabl
y.
 It sets up expectations and then violates them, never in any constant pattern
 that would permit the humming to fade into the background.
 The listener's brain cannot prevent itself from expecting the anti-musical
 phrases to complete, nor prevent itself from noticing the surprises.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The only possible explanation for how this mode of humming came to exist
 is that it was deliberately designed by some unspeakably cruel genius who
 woke up one day, feeling bored with ordinary torture, who decided to handicap
 himself and find out whether he could break someone's sanity 
\emph on
just by humming at them
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Auror has been listening to this unimaginably dreadful humming for four
 hours, while being stared at by a huge, cold, lethal presence that feels
 equally horrible whether he looks at it directly or lets it hover at the
 corner of his vision

From his belt, the Auror took a mirror, tapped it once, and then said, “This

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Code RJ-L20?” the mirror said in surprised tones.
 There was a sound of pages being flipped, then, “You want to be relieved

\begin_layout Standard
(Amelia Bones really is quite intelligent.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“What'd the prisoner say to you?” said the mirror.

\begin_layout Standard

“He's

 The Defense Professor was now leaning in back in his chair, looking quite
 relaxed.
 “He was

\emph on

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a pause.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mirror spoke again.
 “And you're calling in an RJ-L20 over that? You're sure you're not just
 trying to get out of watching him?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Amelia Bones is surrounded by idiots.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“You don't understand!” yelled Auror Altunay.
 “It's really awful humming!”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mirror transmitted a sound of muffled laughter in the background, sounding
 like it was coming from more than one person.
 Then speech again.
 “Mr.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Auror turned back to look triumphantly at where the current Defense
 Professor of Hogwarts was leaning back in his cushioned chair.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That man then spoke the first words that had left his lips since he entered
 the cell.

“Goodbye, Mr.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A few minutes later, the door to the detention cell opened, and in walked
 a grey-haired woman, dressed in the crimson-tinged robes of an Auror without
 any sign of rank or other ornamentation, carrying a black leather folder
 under her left arm.
 “You're relieved,” the old woman said abruptly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a brief delay while Auror Altunay tried to explain what had been
 happening.
 This was cut short by a nod and a stark, simple finger pointing out the
 door.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Good evening, Madam Director,” said the Defense Professor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amelia Bones did not acknowledge this statement, but sat down abruptly in
 the vacated chair.
 The old witch opened the black folder and her gaze moved down to the parchments
 therein.
 “Possible hints to the identity of the current Hogwarts Defense Professor,
 as compiled by Auror Robards.” The title parchment was turned, flipped aside.
 “The Defense Professor said that he was Sorted into Slytherin.
 Claimed that his family was killed by Voldemort.
 Said he had studied at a martial arts center in Muggle Asia which was destroyed
 by Voldemort.
 A request filed with the Department of International Magical Cooperation
 identifies this incident as the Oni Affair of 1969.” Another parchment was
 flipped aside.
 “It also seems this Defense Professor gave a most stirring speech to his
 students, just before last Yule, castigating the previous generation for
 their disunity against the Death Eaters.” The old witch looked up from the
 leather folder.
 “Madam Longbottom was rather taken with it, and insisted that I read the
 entire thing.
 The argument struck me as familiar, though I could not place it at the
 time.
 But then, of course, I had thought you dead.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The chief law enforcement officer of Magical Britain was now gazing sharply
 at the current Defense Professor of Hogwarts, across the pane of spell-reinforc
ed glass separating them.
 The man in the cell returned the gaze equably, without apparent alarm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I shall not name any names,” said the old witch.
 “But I shall tell a story, and see if it sounds familiar.” Amelia Bones
 looked back down, turning to the next parchment.
 “Born 1927, entered Hogwarts in 1938, sorted into Slytherin, graduated
 1945.
 Went on a graduation tour abroad and disappeared while visiting Albania.
 Presumed dead until 1970, when he returned to magical Britain just as suddenly,
 without any explanation for the missing twenty-five years.
 He remained estranged from his family and friends, living in isolation.
 In 1971, while visiting Diagon Alley, he fended off an attempt by Bellatrix
 Black to kidnap the daughter of the Minister of Magic, and used the Killing
 Curse to slay two of the three Death Eaters accompanying her.
 Beyond this all Britain knows the story; need I continue it?” The old witch
 looked up from her folder again.
 “Very well.
 There was a trial in the Wizengamot, during which this young man was exonerated
 for his use of the Killing Curse, not least due to the efforts of his grandmoth
er, the Lady of his House.
 He was reconciled with his family, and they held a House gathering to welcome
 his return.
 The guest of honor arrived at that gathering to find his entire family
 slain by Death Eaters, even to the house elves; and that he himself, of
 cadet line, was now the last remaining scion of a Most Ancient House.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Defense Professor had not reacted at all to any of this, except that
 his eyes had half-closed, as though in weariness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“The young man took up his family's seat in the Wizengamot, becoming among
 the most steadfast voices against You-Know-Who.
 Several times he led forces against the Death Eaters, fighting with skillful
 tactics and extraordinary power.
 People began to speak of him as the next Dumbledore, it was thought that
 he might become Minister of Magic after the Dark Lord fell.
 On the third of July, 1973, he failed to appear at a key Wizengamot vote,
 and was never heard from again.
 We assumed You-Know-Who had killed him.
 It was a grave blow to all of us, and matters went much the worse from
 that day on.” The old witch's gaze was questioning.
 “I mourned you myself.
 What happened?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Defense Professor's shoulders moved lightly, a small shrug.
 “You make many assumptions,” the Defense Professor said softly.
 “For myself, I would believe that man died years ago.
 But if that man is nonetheless alive 
\begin_inset ERT

 then it is clear he does not wish the fact announced, and has reasons enough
 for silence.
 That man was once of some help to you, it seems.” The Defense Professor's
 lips curved in a cynical smile.
 “But I am no longer surprised when gratitude is fleeting.
 Is there yet more that you would demand from him?”
\end_layout

When Hermione woke the third time (though it felt like she'd only closed
 her eyes for a moment) the Sun was even lower in the sky, almost fully

 She felt a little more alive and, strangely, even more exhausted.
 This time it was Professor Flitwick who was standing next to her bed and
 shaking her shoulder, a tray of steaming food floating next to him.
 For some reason she'd thought Harry Potter ought to be leaning over her

“So,” Harry said abruptly, “I did a quick skim through my psychology books
 to see what they said about post-traumatic stress disorder.
 The old books said you should talk about the experience immediately afterward
 with a counselor.
 The newer research says that when they actually ran experiments, it turned
 out that talking about it immediately afterward made it worse.
 Apparently what you really ought to do is run with your mind's natural
 impulse to repress the memories and just not think about it for a while.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was so

“I'm sorry I wasn't waiting when you woke up,” Harry said, as they started

 “Madam Pomfrey wouldn't let me in, so I just stayed out here.” He gave a
 small, sad-looking shrug.
 “I suppose I should be out there trying to run damage control on public

 Anyway, all people understood was that the pro-Malfoy faction had been

 give her a serious look.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Her mind was 
\emph on
slow to remember
\emph default
 for a few seconds, which frightened her, but then the reference came back.
 In 1951, Solomon Asch had taken some experimental subjects, and each one
 had been put among a row of other people who looked like them, seeming
 like other experimental subjects, but actually confederates of the experimenter.
 They'd shown a reference line on a screen, labeled X, next to three other
 lines, labeled A, B, and C.
 The experimenter had asked which line X was the same length as.
 The correct answer had obviously been C.
 The other `subjects', the confederates, had one after another said that
 X was the same length as B.
 The real subject had been put second-to-last in the order, so as not to
 arouse suspicion by being last.
 The test had been to see whether the real subject would `conform' to the
 standard wrong answer of B, or voice the obviously correct answer of C.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
75% of the subjects had `conformed' at least once.
 A third of the subjects had conformed more than half the time.
 Some had reported afterward actually believing that X was the same length
 as B.
 And that had been in a case where the subjects hadn't known any of the
 confederates.
 If you put people around others who belonged to the same group as them,
 like someone in a wheelchair next to other people in a wheelchair, the
 conformity effect got even stronger…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hermione had a sickening feeling where this was going.
 “I remember,” she whispered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I gave the Chaos Legion anti-conformity training, you know.

 Quirrell's face was in shadow, as he looked upward.
 “Perhaps, by taking on himself the curse of action, that man removed it
 from all others? Was that why they felt free to hinder his battle against
 the Dark Wizard who would have enslaved them all? Believing men would act
 in their own interest was not cynicism, it turned out, but sheerest optimism;
 in reality men do not meet so high a standard.
 And so in time that one realized he might do better fighting the Dark Wizard
 alone, than with such followers at his back.”

 “You left your friends behind where they'd be safe, and tried to attack
 the Dark Wizard all by yourself?”

“Why, no,” said Professor Quirrell.
 “I stopped trying to be a hero, and went off to do something else I found
 more pleasant.”

The Defense Professor turned his head down from the sky to regard her; and
 she saw, in the light of the doorway, that he was smiling

 or at least half his face was smiling.
 “Are you going to tell me, Miss Granger, that I am an awful person? Well,
 perhaps I am.
 But then are people who never even try to be heroes still worse? If I had
 never done anything at all, like them, would you have thought better of
 me?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hermione opened her mouth and then found that, once again, she didn't have
 anything to say.
 It wasn't right to walk away from being a hero, you couldn't just 
\emph on
do
\emph default
 that, but she didn't
\emph on
 want
\emph default
 to say that everyone who wasn't a hero was nothing, that was Quirrell-thinking…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The smile, or half-smile, had disappeared.
 “You were foolish,” the Defense Professor said quietly, “to expect any
 lasting gratitude from those you tried to protect, once you named yourself
 a heroine.
 Just as you expected that man to go on being a hero, and called him horrible
 for stopping, when a thousand others never lifted a finger.
 It was only 
\emph on
expected
\emph default
 that you should fight bullies.
 It was a tax you owed, and they accepted it like princes, with a sneer
 for the lateness of your payment.
 And you have already witnessed, I wager, that their fondness vanished like
 dust in the wind once it was no longer in their interest to associate with
 you…”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Defense Professor slowly straightened off the balcony, standing almost
 straight, turning to regard her fully.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“But you don't have to be a hero, Miss Granger,” said Professor Quirrell.
 “You can stop anytime you please.”

 Headmaster Dumbledore had told her.
 The trouble was that there seemed to be two different right things to do.
 There was the part of her which said that

right
\emph default
 was to go on being a heroine, and stay at Hogwarts, she didn't know what
 was going on but a heroine wouldn't just run away.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And there was also the voice of common sense saying that young children
 shouldn't ever stay around danger, that was what adults were for; the voice
 of every school poster that said not to take candy from strangers.
 That was also right.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hermione Granger stood there on that balcony, looking at Professor Quirrell
 silhouetted by the emerging stars, and she didn't understand; she didn't
 understand how the Defense Professor could be gazing at her with his face
 showing concern; she didn't understand the notes of pain in the Defense
 Professor's voice that caught at her; she didn't understand 
\emph on
why
\emph default
 she was being told all this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“You don't even like me, Professor,” said Hermione.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A small smile flickered on Professor Quirrell's face.
 “I suppose I could go on about how I am angered that this affair has taken
 up my valuable time and disrupted my Defense classes.
 But mostly, Miss Granger, you are my student, and whatever other professions
 I may have once held, I think I have been a good teacher at Hogwarts, have
 I not?” Suddenly Professor Quirrell's eyes seemed very tired.
 “As your teacher, then, I am advising you that you have other career options.
 I should not like to see anyone else going down my path.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hermione swallowed.
 It was a side of Professor Quirrell she'd never seen or imagined, and it
 was eating away at her preconceptions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor Quirrell watched her for a moment, and then looked away from her
 again, back up at the stars.
 When he spoke this time his voice was quieter.
 “Someone here is targeting you, Miss Granger, and I cannot ward you as
 I warded Mr.

 The Headmaster has prevented it, for what he claims to be good reasons.
 It is easy to become fond of Hogwarts, I know, for I am fond of it as well.
 But in France they take a different view of the Ancient Houses than in
 Britain; and Beauxbatons would not mistreat you, I think.
 Whatever else you imagine of me, I swear that if you asked me to see you
 safely in Beauxbatons, I would do all in my power to convey you there.”

“But you

 Miss Granger.” Now the pale blue eyes watched her intently.
 “Whatever you wish to make of your life, you cannot attain it at Hogwarts,
 not anymore.
 This place is ruined for you now, even leaving aside all other threats.
 Simply ask Harry Potter to command you to go to Beauxbatons and live out
 your life in peace.
 If you stay here, he is your master in the eyes of Britain and its laws!”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She hadn't even been thinking about that, it paled so much in comparison
 to being eaten by Dementors; it had been important to her before, but now
 it all seemed childish, unimportant, pointless, so why were her eyes burning?

“So you think I am the one responsible?” said Professor Quirrell.
 His voice sounded a little sad as he said it, and her own heart almost
 stopped from hearing it.
 “I suppose I cannot blame you.
 I am the Defense Professor of Hogwarts, after all.
 But Miss Granger, even

 me

 You cannot use the Killing Curse, so the correct tactic is to Apparate

 “No, Miss Granger.
 Your departure will take time for me to arrange, and I have less time left

 This decision may be painful for you, but it should not be ambiguous; much
 weighs in the balance of these scales, but not evenly.

Hermione swallowed, she swayed a little where she stood, on the stone balcony
 of a magical castle.
 Suddenly the whole deadly absurdity of the situation seemed to rise up
 and grab her by the throat, that twelve-year-old girls

shouldn't

 shouldn't

And she knew, then, as Harry and Dumbledore had both tried to warn her,
 that everything she'd ever thought about being a heroine had been mistaken.
 That there wasn't really any such thing as heroes, outside of stories.
 There was just horrible danger, and being arrested by Aurors and put in
 cells next to Dementors, pain and fear and

 All the words were blocked in her throat.

“I need a decision, Miss Granger.”

\begin_layout Standard
She kept her jaw locked, didn't let any words come out.

Finally the Defense Professor sighed.
 Slowly the white light failed, and slowly the door behind him swung open,
 so that he was once again a black silhouette against the opening.
 “Good night, Miss Granger,” he said, and turned his back to her, and walked
 away into Hogwarts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It took a while for her breathing to slow down again.
 Whatever had happened here tonight, it didn't feel anything like victory.
 She'd fought so hard just to stop herself from saying

Yes

 know if she'd done the right thing.

When she walked back into the light herself (after exhaustion had overtaken
 everything and sleep was once more a possibility), she thought she heard
 it as she was within the doorway, from behind her and above her, a distant
 cawing cry.

But it wasn't meant for her, she knew, so she started climbing up the stairs
 toward her dorm room.
