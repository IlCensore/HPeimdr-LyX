 si muoveva davanti per dare l'andatura, e dietro di essa seguiva una brillante
 figura d'argento, tutte le altre entità invisibili.
 Avevano attraversato cinque tratti di corridoio, e girato a destra cinque
 volte e salito cinque rampe di scale; e quando Bellatrix ebbe terminato
 la sua seconda bottiglia di latte al cioccolato, aveva ricevuto delle barrette
 di cioccolato solido da mangiare.

Fu dopo la sua terza barretta di cioccolato che strani rumori iniziarono

Ci volle un momento a Harry per comprendere, per elaborare i suoni, non
 sembrava simile a nulla che avesse mai sentito prima; il suo ritmo era
 in frantumi, quasi irriconoscibile, gli ci volle così tanto per capire
 che Bellatrix stava piangendo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bellatrix Black stava piangendo, l'arma più terribile del Signore Oscuro

Every exposed surface now burned like a white sun in the reflections, the
 silhouette of Bellatrix's skeleton and the sallow man now clearly visible

 it.

They were far from him, the Dementors in their pit, but Harry knew that
 they could be destroyed even at this distance if the light blazed bright
 enough, he knew that Death itself could not face him if he stopped holding
 back, so he unsealed all the gates inside him and sank the wells of his
 spell into all the deepest parts of his spirit, all his mind and all his
 will, and gave over absolutely everything to the spell

The sudden sense of doom clashed with Harry's steel determination, dread
 and uncertainty striving against the bright purpose, nothing else might
 have reached him but that.
 The silhouette took another step forward and another, the sense of doom
 rising to a point of terrible catastrophe; and in the drench of cold water,
 Harry saw it, he realized the consequences of what he was doing, the danger
 and the trap.

She was already pushing herself off the floor, slowly, like an old, old
 Muggle woman.
 “How funny,” Bellatrix whispered, “you were almost killed by a Patronus
 Charm…” A giggle that sounded like it was blowing dust out of her giggle
 pipes.
 “I could punish you, maybe, if my Lord froze you in place and I had knives…
 maybe I can be useful after all? Oh, I feel a little better now, how strange…”

“Be silent, dear Bella,” Harry said in a chill voice, “until I give you

And Harry knew that as they passed, the prisoners were stirring in their
 cells as the fear lifted for one precious moment, maybe even feeling a
 small touch of healing as his light passed them by, and then collapsing
 down again as the cold and darkness pressed back in.

In the Auror's quarters at the top of Azkaban, one Auror trio was snoring
 in the barracks, one Auror trio was resting in the breakroom, and one Auror
 trio was on duty in the command room, keeping their watch.
 The command room was simple but large, with three chairs at back where
 three Aurors sat, their wands always in hand to sustain their three Patronuses,
 as the bright white forms paced in front of the open window, sheltering
 them all from the Dementors' fear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The three of them usually stuck to the back, and played poker, and didn't
 look out the window.
 You could have seen some sky there, sure, and there was even an hour or
 two every day where you could've seen some sun, but that window also looked
 down on the central pit of hell.

Just in case a Dementor wanted to float up and talk to you.

\begin_layout Standard
There was no way that Auror Li would have agreed to serve duty here, triple
 pay or no triple pay, if he hadn't had a family to support.
 (His real name was Xiaoguang, and everyone called him Mike instead; he'd
 named his children Su and Kao, which hopefully would serve them better.)
 His only consolation, besides the money, was that at least his mates played
 an excellent game of Dragon Poker.
 Though it would be hard

 to, at this point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was their 5,366th game and Li had what would probably be his best hand
 of the 5300s.
 It was a Saturday in February and there were three players, which let him
 shift the suit of any one hole card except a two, three, or seven; and
 that was enough to let him build a Corps-a-Corps with Unicorns, Dragons,
 and sevens…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Across the table from him, Gerard McCusker looked up from the table cards
 toward the direction of the window, staring.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sinking feeling came over Li's stomach with surprising speed.

\begin_layout Standard

“Mike,” said McCusker, “what's with your Patronus?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Li turned his head and looked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His soft silver badger had turned away from its watch over the pit and was
 staring downward at something only it could see.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A moment later, Bahry's moonlit duck and McCusker's bright anteater followed
 suit, staring in the same downward direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They all exchanged glances, and then sighed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I'll tell them,” said Bahry.
 Protocol called for sending the three Aurors who were off-duty but not
 sleeping to investigate anything anomalous.
 “May\SpecialChar \-
be relieve one of them and take the C spiral, if you two don't mind.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Li exchanged a glance with McCusker, and they both nodded.
 It wasn't too hard to break into Azkaban, if you were wealthy enough to
 hire a powerful wizard, and well-intentioned enough to recruit someone
 who could cast the Patronus Charm.
 People with friends in Azkaban would do that, break in just to give someone
 a half-day's worth of Patronus time, a chance at some real dreams instead
 of nightmares.
 Leave them a supply of chocolate to conceal in their cell, to increase
 the chance they lived through their sentence.
 And the Aurors on guard… well, even if you got caught, you could probably
 convince the Aurors to overlook it, in exchange for the right bribe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For Li, the right bribe tended to be in the range of two Knuts and a silver
 Sickle.
 He hated this place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But Bahry One-Hand had a wife and the wife had healer's bills, and if you
 could afford to hire someone who could break into Azkaban, then you could
 afford to grease Bahry's remaining palm pretty hard, if he was the one
 who caught you.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By unspoken agreement, none of them giving anything away by being the first
 to propose it, the three of them finished out their poker hand first.
 Li won, since no Dementors had actually shown up.
 And by then the Patronuses had stopped staring and gone back to their normal
 patrol, so it was probably nothing, but procedure was procedure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After Li raked in the pot, Bahry gave them all formal nods, and stood up
 from the table.
 The older man's long white locks brushed against his fancy red robes, his
 robes brushed the metal floor of the command room, as Bahry went through
 the separating door that led to the formerly off-duty Aurors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Li had been Sorted into Hufflepuff, and he sometimes felt a little queasy
 about this kind of business.
 But Bahry had shown them all the pictures, and you had to let a man do
 what he could for his poor sick wife, especially when he only had seven
 months left before his retirement.

The faint green spark floated through the metal corridors, and the silver
 humanoid, seeming a little dimmer now, followed after it.
 Sometimes the bright figure would flare, especially when they passed one
 of the huge metal doors, but it always died back down again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mere eyes could not have seen the invisible others: the eleven-year-old
 Boy-Who-Lived, and the living skeleton that was Bellatrix Black, and the
 Poly\SpecialChar \-
juiced Defense Professor of Hogwarts, all traveling together through
 Azkaban.
 If that was the beginning of a joke, Harry didn't know the punchline.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They'd gone up another four flights of stairs before the rough voice of
 the Defense Professor said, simply and without emphasis, “Auror coming.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It took too long, a whole second maybe, for Harry to understand, for the
 jolt of adrenaline to pump into his blood, and for him to remember what
 Professor Quirrell had already discussed with him and told him to do in
 this case, and then Harry spun on his heel and flew back the way they'd
 come.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry reached the flight of stairs, and frantically laid himself down on
 the third step from the top, the cold metal feeling hard even through his
 cloak and robes.
 Trying to move his head up, to peer over the lip of the stairs, showed
 that he couldn't see Professor Quirrell; and that meant that Harry was
 out of the line of any stray fire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His shining Patronus followed after him, and lay down beside him on the
 step just beneath him; for it too must not be seen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a faint sound as of wind or whooshing, and then the sound of Bellatrix

“Stay still,” said the cold high whisper, “stay silent.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was stillness, and silence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry pressed his wand against the side of the metal step just above him.
 If he was anyone else he would have needed to take a Knut out of his pocket…
 or rip off a bit of cloth from his robe… or bite off one of his nails…
 or find a speck of rock large enough that he could see it and solid enough
 to stay in one place and orientation while it touched his wand.
 But with Harry's almighty power of partial Transfiguration, this was not
 necessary; he could skip that particular step of the operation and use
 any material near to hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thirty seconds later Harry was the proud new owner of a curved mirror, and…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“

Wingardium Leviosa,

” Harry whispered as quietly as he could.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
…was levitating it just above the steps, and watching, in that curved surface,
 almost the whole corridor where Professor Quirrell invisibly waited.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry heard it in the distance, then, the sound of footsteps.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And saw the form (a little hard to see in the mirror) of a person in red
 robes, coming down the stairs, entering the seemingly empty corridor; accompani

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Auror was protected by a blue shimmer, it was hard to see the details
 but Harry could see that much, the Auror had shields already raised and

 According to the Defense Professor, the essential art of dueling consisted
 of trying to put up defenses that would block whatever someone was likely
 to throw at you, while trying in turn to attack in ways that were likely
 to go past their current set of defenses.
 And by far the easiest way to win any sort of real fight

The man's wand had moved so fast that it was like it had Apparated into

“My offer has gone back down to five hundred Galleons,” said the man in

 He smiled dryly, and the smile looked wrong on that bearded face.
 “And you shall need to accept a Memory Charm.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bahry had already swapped the harmonics on his shields so that his own stunner
 couldn't pass back through, already tilted his wand back into a defensive
 position, already raised his hardened artificial hand into position to
 block anything blockable, and was already thinking wordless spells to put
 more layers on his shields

The man wasn't looking at Bahry.
 Instead he was poking curiously at Bahry's stunner where it still wavered
 on the end of his wand, drawing out red sparks and flicking them away with
 his fingers, slowly disassembling the hex like a child's rod puzzle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The man hadn't raised any shields of his own.

 “what did you do in the last war? Put yourself in harm's way, or stay out

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Harm's way,” said Bahry.
 His voice kept the iron calm of an Auror with nearly a hundred full years
 on the force, seven months short of mandatory retirement, Mad-Eye Moody
 couldn't have said it with any more hardness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Fight any Death Eaters?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now a grim smile graced Bahry's own face.
 “Two at once.” Two of You-Know-Who's own warrior-assassins, personally trained
 by their dark master.
 Two Death Eaters at once against Bahry alone.
 It had been the toughest fight of Bahry's life, but he'd stood his ground,
 and walked away with only the loss of his left hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Did you kill them?” The man sounded idly curious, and he continued to draw
 threads of fire out of the much-diminished stunbolt still captive on the
 end of his wand, his fingers now weaving small patterns of Bahry's own
 magic before flicking to disperse them.

The mirror lay dull and lifeless in his hand.
 Slowly, Bahry put it back on his belt.

“It's been quite a while since I had a serious fight with a serious opponent,”
 the man said, still not looking up at Bahry.
 “Try not to disappoint me too much.
 You can attack whenever you're ready.

There was a long silence.

Harry could hardly see it, could hardly make out anything amid the lights
 and flashes, his mirror's curve was perfect (they'd practiced that tactic

 from a meter away, it was all happening too

 red blasts deflecting from blue shields, green bars of light clashing together,
 shadowy forms appearing and vanishing, he couldn't even tell who was casting
 what, except that the Auror was shouting incantation after incantation

 in one place and flicked his wand, mostly silently, but now and then pronouncin

 and show half the Auror's shielding torn away as he staggered back.

Harry had seen exhibition duels between the strongest seventh-year students,
 and this was so far above it that Harry's mind felt numbed, looking at
 how far he had left to go.
 There wasn't a single seventh-year student who could have lasted half a
 minute against the Auror, all three seventh-year armies put together might
 not be able to scratch the Defense Professor…

\begin_layout Standard
The Auror had fallen to the ground, one knee and one hand supporting himself
 as the other hand gestured frantically and his mouth shouted desperate
 words, the few incantations that Harry recognized were all shield spells,
 as a flock of shadows spun around the Auror like a whirlwind of razors.

And Harry saw Professor Quirrell's Polyjuiced form deliberately point his

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the dreadful flux and pressure began to dissipate, as the wild wizardry
 died back down, Bahry's dazed mind noticed that the scream was continuing.
 Only it sounded different, like the scream of a young boy, coming from
 the stairs leading down to the next lower level.

That scream choked off too, and then there was silence except for Bahry's

Bahry managed to summon the energy to press his wand against his rib, mutter
 the healing spell, and then press it again to his shoulder.
 It took more out of him than it should have, took far too much out of him,
 his magic was within a bare breath of utter exhaustion; he didn't have
 anything left for his minor cuts and bruises or even to reinforce the scraps
 left of his shielding.
 It was all he could do not to let his Patronus go out.

“You,” Bahry said.
