 Che io stesso, alla stessa età, ero alquanto straordinariamente sciocco.
 Lei parla con lo stile di un adulto e si immischia in giochi per adulti,

 Spero, signor Potter, che la sua infantile intromissione non abbia appena

Professor Quirrell, ho detto molto meno di quanto desiderassi dire, ma dovevo
 dire qualcosa.
 Le sue proposte sono estremamente allarmanti per chiunque abbia la minima
 familiarità con la storia babbana dell'ultimo secolo.
 I fascisti italiani, persone davvero sgradevoli, presero il loro nome dai

 I suoi occhi si chiusero brevemente, poi si aprirono.
 
\begin_inset Quotes fld

Signor Potter, la stupidità del Quidditch le è trasparente perché lei non
 è cresciuto riverendo il gioco.
 Se non avesse mai sentito parlare delle elezioni, signor Potter, e semplicement
e 
\emph on
vedesse cosa accade
\emph default
, ciò che vedrebbe non le piacerebbe.
 Guardi al nostro Ministro della Magia eletto.
 È il più saggio, il più forte, il più grande della nostra Nazione? No;
 è un buffone di proprietà esclusiva di Lucius Malfoy.
 I maghi andarono alle urne e scelsero tra Cornelius Fudge e Tania Leach,
 che avevano gareggiato in una grandiosa e interessante competizione dopo
 che la 
\emph on
Gazzetta del Profeta
\emph default
, anche questa controllata da Lucius Malfoy, decise che erano gli unici
 candidati seri.
 Che Cornelius Fudge sia stato sinceramente selezionato come il miglior
 capo che il nostro Paese potesse offrire non è un suggerimento che chiunque
 potrebbe proporre con la faccia seria.
 Non è diverso nel mondo babbano, da quanto ho sentito e visto; l'ultimo
 quotidiano babbano che ho letto menzionava che il precedente Presidente
 degli Stati Uniti era stato un attore in pensione.
 Se non fosse cresciuto con le elezioni, signor Potter, sarebbero per lei
 tanto trasparentemente stupide quanto il Quidditch

Harry rimase seduto con la bocca aperta, lottando per trovare le parole.

Lo scopo delle elezioni non è produrre il singolo miglior capo, è mantenere

L'ultima guerra, signor Potter, fu combattuta tra il Signore Oscuro e Silente.
 E mentre Silente era un capo imperfetto che stava perdendo la guerra, è
 
\emph on
ridicolo
\emph default
 suggerire che 
\emph on
uno qualunque
\emph default
 dei Ministri della Magia eletti in quel periodo avrebbe potuto prendere
 il posto di Silente! La forza scorre dai maghi potenti e dai loro seguaci,
 non dalle elezioni e dai folli che eleggono.
 Questa è la lezione della storia recente della Gran Bretagna magica; e
 io dubito che la prossima guerra le insegnerà una lezione differente.

Se

Tali pericoli
\begin_inset Quotes frd
\end_inset

, disse freddamente il professor Quirrell, 
\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

devono essere discussi in uffici come questo, non nei discorsi.
 I folli che hanno eletto Cornelius Fudge non sono interessati in complicazioni

 Offra loro qualcosa di più ricco di sfumature di un grido d'incitamento,
 e fronteggerà la sua guerra da solo.

Quello
\emph default
, signor Potter, è stato il suo errore infantile, che Draco Malfoy non avrebbe

 Sarebbe dovuto essere ovvio persino per

 “You must learn to blur your vision until you can see the forest obscured

 Anyone who heard the stories about you, and who did not know that you were
 the mysterious Boy-Who-Lived, could easily deduce your ownership of an
 invisibility cloak.
 Step back from these events, blur away their details, and what do we observe?
 There was a great rivalry between students, and their competition ended
 in a perfect tie.
 That sort of thing only happens in stories, Mr.

\end_inset

Potter, and there is one person in this school who thinks in stories.
 There was a strange and complicated plot, which you should have realized
 was uncharacteristic of the young Slytherin you faced.
 But there is a person in this school who deals in plots that elaborate,
 and his name is not Zabini.
 And I did warn you that there was a quadruple agent; you knew that Zabini
 was at least a triple agent, and you should have guessed a high chance
 that it was he.
 No, I will not declare the battle invalid.
 All three of you failed the test, and lost to your common enemy.”

Harry didn't care about tests at this point.

 “Perhaps the Headmaster thought the rivalry was good for his pet hero and

Aftermath: Harry Potter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry trudged slowly toward the Ravenclaw dorm, eyes unseeing of walls,
 paintings, or other students; he went up stairs and down ramps without
 slowing, speeding, or noticing where he trod.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It had taken him more than a minute after Professor Quirrell's departure
 to realize that his only source of information about Dumbledore being involved
 was (a) Blaise Zabini, who he would have to be an absolute gaping idiot
 to trust again, and (b) Professor Quirrell, who could have easily faked
 a plot in Dumbledore's style, and who might also think that a little student
 rivalry was a fine thing; and who had, if you stepped back and blurred
 out the details, just proposed turning the country into a magical dictatorship.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And it was also possible that Dumbledore 
\emph on
was
\emph default
 the one behind Zabini, and that Professor Quirrell had been sincerely trying
 to fight the Dark Mark in kind, and prevent the repetition of a performance
 he saw as pathetic.
 Trying to make sure that Harry didn't end up fighting the Dark Lord alone,
 while everyone else hid, frightened, trying to stay out of the line of
 fire, waiting for Harry to save them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But the truth was…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry was sort of okay with that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was, he knew, the kind of thing that was supposed to make heroes resentful
 and bitter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To heck with that.
 Harry was very much in favor of everyone else 
\emph on
staying out of danger
\emph default
 while the Boy-Who-Lived took down the Dark Lord by himself, plus or minus
 a small number of companions.
 If the next conflict with the Dark Lord got to the point of a Second Wizarding
 War that killed lots of people and embroiled a whole country, that would
 mean Harry had 
\emph on
already failed
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And if afterward a war broke out between wizards and Muggles, it didn't
 matter who won, Harry would have already failed by letting it get that
 far.
 Besides, who said the societies couldn't peacefully integrate when the
 secrecy inevitably broke down? (Though Harry could hear Professor Quirrell's
 dry voice in his mind, asking him if he was a fool, and saying all the
 obvious things…) And if mages and Muggles couldn't live in peace, then
 Harry would combine magic and science and figure out how to evacuate all
 the wizards to Mars or somewhere, instead of letting a war break out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because if it did come down to a war of extermination…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That was the thing Professor Quirrell hadn't realized, the one most important
 question he'd forgotten to ask his young general.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The real reason why Harry had no intention of being argued into endorsing
 a Light Mark, no matter 
\emph on
how
\emph default
 much it would help him in his fight against the Dark Lord.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One Dark Lord and fifty Marked followers had been a peril to all of magical
 Britain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If all Britain took the Mark of a strong leader, they would be a peril to
 the whole magical world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And if the whole wizarding world took a single Mark, they would be a danger
 to the rest of humanity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No one knew quite how many wizards there were in the world.
 He'd done a few estimates with Hermione and come up with numbers in the
 rough range of a million.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But there were six billion Muggles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If it came down to a final war…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor Quirrell had forgotten to ask Harry which side he would protect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A scientific civilization, reaching outward, looking upward, knowing that
 its destiny was to grasp the stars.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 by a nobility that saw Muggles as not quite human.

Blaise strolled through the hallways with careful, self-imposed slowness,
 his heart beating wildly as he tried to calm down

\begin_layout Standard
“Ahem,” said a dry, whispering voice from a shadowy alcove as he passed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Blaise jumped, but he didn't scream.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Slowly, he turned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In that small, shadowy corner was a black cloak so wide and billowing that
 it was impossible to determine whether the figure beneath was male or female,
 and atop the cloak a broad-brimmed black hat, and a black mist seemed to
 gather beneath it and obscure the face of whoever or whatever might lie
 beneath.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Report,” whispered Mr.
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Hat and Cloak.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I said just what you told me to,” said Blaise.
 His voice was a little calmer now that he wasn't lying to anyone.
 “And Professor Quirrell reacted just the way you expected.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The broad black hat tilted and straightened, as though the head below had
 nodded.
 “Excellent,” said the unidentifiable whisper.
 “The reward I promised you is already on its way to your mother, by owl.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Blaise hesitated, but his curiosity was eating him alive.
 “Can I ask now why you want to cause trouble between Professor Quirrell
 and Dumbledore?” The Headmaster hadn't had anything to do with the Gryffindor
 bullies that Blaise knew about, and besides helping Kimberly, the Headmaster
 had also offered to make Professor Binns give him excellent marks in History
 of Magic even if he turned in blank parchments for his homework, though
 he'd still have to attend class and pretend to hand them in.
 Actually Blaise would have betrayed all three generals for free, and never
 mind his cousin either, but he'd seen no need to say that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The broad black hat cocked to one side, as if to convey a quizzical stare.
 “Tell me, friend Blaise, did it occur to you that traitors who betray so
 many times over often meet with ill ends?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Nope,” said Blaise, looking straight into the black mist under the hat.
 “Everyone knows that nothing 
\emph on
really
\emph default
 bad ever happens to students in Hogwarts.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mr.

Hat and Cloak gave a whispery chuckle.
 “Indeed,” said the whisper.
 “With the murder of one student five decades ago being the exception that
 proves the rule, since Salazar Slytherin would have keyed his monster into
 the ancient wards at a higher level than the Headmaster himself.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Blaise stared at the black mist, now beginning to feel a little uneasy.
 But it ought to take a Hogwarts professor to do anything significant to
 him without setting off alarms.
 Quirrell and Snape were the only professors who'd do something like this,
 and Quirrell wouldn't care about fooling 
\emph on
himself
\emph default
, and Snape wouldn't hurt one of his own Slytherins… would he?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“No, friend Blaise,” whispered the black mist, “I only wished to advise
 you never to try anything like this in your adult life.
 So many betrayals would certainly lead to at least one vengeance.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“My 
\emph on
mother
\emph default
 never got any vengeances,” said Blaise proudly.
 “Even though she married 
\emph on
seven
\emph default
 husbands and every single one of them died mysteriously and left her lots
 of money.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Really?” said the whisper.
 “However did she persuade the seventh to marry her after he heard what
 happened to the first six?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I asked Mum that,” said Blaise, “and she said I couldn't know until I was
 old enough, and I asked her how old was old enough, and she said, older
 than her.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Again the whispery chuckle.
 “Well then, friend Blaise, my congratulations on having followed in your
 mother's footsteps.
 Go, and if you say nothing of this, we will not meet again.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Blaise backed uneasily away, feeling an odd reluctance to turn his back.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hat tilted.
 “Oh, come now, little Slytherin.
 If you were truly the equal of Harry Potter or Draco Malfoy, you would
 have already realized that my hinted threats were just to ensure your silence
 before Albus.
 Had I intended to harm, I would not have hinted; had I said nothing, 
\emph on
then
\emph default
 you should have worried.”

Blaise straightened, feeling a little insulted, and nodded to Mr.

Aftermath: Hermione Granger.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The messenger didn't approach her until she was alone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hermione was just leaving the girl's bathroom where she sometimes hid to
 think, and a bright shining cat leaped out of nowhere and said, “Miss Granger?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She let out a little shriek before she realized the cat had spoken in Professor
 McGonagall's voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even so she hadn't been frightened, only startled; the cat was bright and
 brilliant and beautiful, glowing with a white silver radiance like moon-colored
 sunlight, and she couldn't imagine being scared.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“What are you?” said Hermione.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“This is a message from Professor McGonagall,” said the cat, still in the
 Professor's voice.
 “Can you come to my office, and not speak of this to anyone?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I'll be there right away,” said Hermione, still surprised, and the cat
 leaped and vanished; only it didn't vanish, it traveled away somehow; or
 that was what her mind said, even though her eyes just saw it disappear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the time Hermione had got to the office of her favorite professor, her
 mind was all a-whirl with speculations.
 Was there something wrong with her Transfiguration scores? But then why
 would Professor McGonagall say not to tell anyone? It was probably about
 Harry practicing his partial Transfiguration…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor McGonagall's face looked worried, not stern, as Hermione seated
 herself in front of the desk

 trying to keep her eyes from going to the nest of cubbyholes containing
 Professor McGonagall's homework, she'd always wondered what sort of work
 grownups had to do to keep the school running and whether they could use
 any help from her…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Miss Granger,” said Professor McGonagall, “let me start by saying that
 I already know about the Headmaster asking you to make that wish

“He

 you?” blurted Hermione in startlement.
 The Headmaster had said no one else was supposed to know!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor McGonagall paused, looked at Hermione, and gave a sad little chuckle.
 “It's good to see Mr.
\begin_inset ERT

\end_inset

Potter hasn't corrupted you too much.
 Miss Granger, you aren't supposed to 
\emph on
admit
\emph default
 anything just because I say I know.
 As it happens, the Headmaster did 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 tell me, I simply know him too well.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hermione was blushing furiously now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“It's fine, Miss Granger!” said Professor McGonagall hastily.
 “You're a Ravenclaw in your first year, nobody expects you to be a Slytherin.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That 
\emph on
really
\emph default
 stung.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Fine,” said Hermione with some acerbity, “I'll go ask Harry Potter for
 Sly\SpecialChar \-
therin lessons, then.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“That 
\emph on
wasn't
\emph default
 what I wanted to…” said Professor McGonagall, and her voice trailed off.
 “Miss Granger, I'm worried about this 
\emph on
because
\emph default
 young Ravenclaw girls shouldn't have to be Slytherins! If the Headmaster
 asks you to get involved in something you're not comfortable with, Miss
 Granger, it really is all right to say no.
 And if you're feeling pressured, please tell the Headmaster that you would
 like me to be there, or that you would like to ask me first.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hermione's eyes were very wide.
 “Does the Headmaster do things that are wrong?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor McGonagall looked a little sad at that.
 “Not on purpose, Miss Granger, but I think… well, it probably 
\emph on
is
\emph default
 true that sometimes the Headmaster has trouble remembering what it's like
 to be a child.
 Even when he was a child, I'm sure he must have been brilliant, and strong
 of mind and heart, with courage enough for three Gryffindors.
 Sometimes the Headmaster asks too much of his young students, Miss Granger,
 or isn't careful enough not to hurt them.
 He is a good man, but sometimes his plotting can go too far.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“But it's 
\emph on
good
\emph default
 for students to be strong and have courage,” said Hermione.
 “That's why you suggested Gryffindor for me, wasn't it?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor McGonagall smiled wryly.
 “Perhaps I was only being selfish, wanting you for my own House.
 Did the Sorting Hat offer you

 no, I should not have asked.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“It told me I might go anywhere but Slytherin,” said Hermione.
 She'd 
\emph on
almost
\emph default
 asked why she wasn't good enough for Slytherin, before she'd managed to
 stop herself… “So I 
\emph on
have
\emph default
 courage, Professor!”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor McGonagall leaned forward over her desk.
 The worry was showing plainer on her face now.
 “Miss Granger, it's not about courage, it's about what's healthy for young
 girls! The Headmaster is drawing you into his plots, Harry Potter is giving
 you his secrets to keep, and now you're making alliances with Draco Malfoy!
 And I promised your mother that you would be safe at Hogwarts!”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hermione just didn't know what to say to that.
 But the thought was occurring to her that Professor McGonagall might not
 have been warning her if she'd been a boy in Gryffindor instead of a girl
 in Ravenclaw and 
\emph on
that
\emph default
 was, well… “I'll try to be good,” she said, “and I won't let anyone tell
 me otherwise.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor McGonagall pressed her hands over her eyes.
 When she took them away, her lined face looked very old.
 “Yes,” she said in a whisper, “you would have done well in my House.
 Stay safe, Miss Granger, and be careful.
 And if you are ever worried or uncomfortable about anything, please come
 to me at once.
 I won't keep you any longer.”
